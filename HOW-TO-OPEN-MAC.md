# 🍎 How to Open PDF Document Explorer on Mac

## 📱 **Quick Start for Mac Users**

### ✅ **If you see a security warning:**

1. **Right-click** on `PDF Document Explorer.app` 
2. Select **"Open"** from the menu
3. Click **"Open"** in the security dialog
4. The app will launch and open your browser automatically

### 🎉 **That's it!** 

After doing this once, you can double-click the app normally. macOS will remember your choice.

## 🖥️ **System Requirements**

✅ **macOS 10.9 or later** (Mavericks, 2013+)  
✅ **Intel Mac or Apple Silicon** (with Rosetta)  
✅ **Any web browser**

---

## ❓ **Having trouble?**

**The security warning is normal!** This just means the app isn't from the App Store. The app is completely safe and:

- ✅ Only works with PDF files locally
- ✅ Doesn't access the internet 
- ✅ Doesn't install anything
- ✅ Is completely self-contained

**Alternative method:**
1. Try to open the app (get the warning)
2. Go to System Preferences → Security & Privacy
3. Click "Open Anyway" next to the PDF Document Explorer message

---

## 🚀 **What happens when it works:**

1. **App starts silently** in the background
2. **Browser opens automatically** to the PDF explorer
3. **Ready to use!** Browse and search PDF documents

Works great on older Macs! 🎯
