Dislocation of Muslims from Boeing and Cattin\nFrom 5 December 2013 onwards, the majority of Muslims of Boeing and Cattin, including\nSalehou Ndiaye and P-2682, fled to PK5 in Bangui, while some others fled to other parts of\nthe CAR, in the context of the attack by Mr Yekatom’s group on Boeing and Cattin. Muslim\npersons who fled to PK5 continued to fear for their security because of the presence of the\nAnti-Balaka around PK5 and Bangui generally. With the influx of Muslims fleeing the attack\non Bangui on 5 December 2013, PK5 became overcrowded, practically uninhabitable, and\nunsafe. As a result, some Muslims, including Salehou Ndiaye and P-2682, then fled to\nneighbouring countries fearing for their safety.\nC. The attack on Bossangoa on 5 December 2013\n1. Unfolding of the attack on Bossangoa on 5 December 2013\nOn 5 December 2013, in coordination with the Anti-Balaka attack on Bangui on the same\nday, Anti-Balaka elements, divided into two groups led by Florent Kema and Théophile\nNdangba, respectively, carried out an attack on the town of Bossangoa. The attack started at\napproximately 13:00 and lasted until the late afternoon or early evening.\nDuring the attack, the Anti-Balaka targeted residential areas, including the Boro\nneighbourhood, generally known as the Muslim neighbourhood in Bossangoa, with the\nintention of showing that the Anti-Balaka were attacking not only Bangui but also in the\nprovinces, and to ‘free’ the town from Seleka and all Muslims, thereby targeting Muslim\ncivilians and drawing no distinction between them and the Seleka. During the attack, the\nAnti-Balaka was well armed, with some AK-47s and RPGs, as well as hunting weapons.\nDuring the attack on Bossangoa on 5 December 2013, Batoul Naffi and several other\nindividuals were injured. An Anti-Balaka element forced P-2462 into sexual intercourse,\nhaving blindfolded and undressed her, and after the group of five Anti-Balaka he was in had\nthreatened her with their weapons.\nIn the course of the attack on Bossangoa on 5 December 2013, the Anti-Balaka killed at least\nthe following 18 persons who were not armed or taking part in hostilities: Khadidja Adjaro;\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 30/1616 24 July 2025",

All witnesses who\nwere at Yamwara during the relevant time considered Mr Yekatom to be the ‘chief’ of all\nactivities at Yamwara. Mr Yekatom was also the overall chief on matters of punishment and\nenforcing discipline at Yamwara, and his section chiefs also had a responsibility to discipline\nelements.

Alkanto pointed to\nthe women as belonging to the family of Mamour and Michel Djotodia in the presence of\nthe elements in his group. Alkanto’s identification of the women being related to Djotodia\nand Mamour as well as being Muslims, combined with Alkanto’s negative feelings centred\naround a desire for revenge against the women, predisposed Alkanto’s group to perceive the\nseven persons as ‘Muslims’.\nFollowing Alkanto’s identification of the women, his elements started to threaten the group\nwith death, telling the group that they would be ‘skinned like a papaya’. The expression\n‘peeling’ or ‘skinning’ the ‘papaya’ was used by elements in Mr Yekatom’s group in relation\nto the treatment of captured persons suspected of being Seleka.\nAlkanto ordered his elements to search the male captives at the checkpoint. Alkanto’s\nelements beat P-1704 and P-1716 and accused them of being traitors. Following this search,\nno arms were found on any of the captives. An element searched Saint Cyr and found a\n‘Seleka card’ on him. None of the seven persons posed a threat to Yamwara or the security\nof the elements placed there. In fact, the nature and the purpose of them being together and\nclose to Yamwara was linked to the funeral of Saint Cyr’s older brother.\nAfter threatening them with death and accusing them of being traitors, Alkanto ordered his\nelements to take the seven persons, including Saint Cyr Lapo N’Gomat, P-1704, P-1705, P-\n1716, P-0967 and P-1811, to Yamwara.\nElements in Mr Yekatom’s group, namely Alkanto and others, brought the captives to Cœur\nde Lion’s house at Yamwara. There, in Cœur de Lion’s presence, elements in Mr Yekatom’s\ngroup, including Bojos, interrogated the four men individually on their identity, ethnicity,\nand reasons for being there with the women, also demanding the captive men to speak in the\ndialect associated with their respective ethnicities.

When Saint Cyr was unable to do so, elements in Mr Yekatom’s group\naccused him of being ‘Goula’, and therefore associated with Djotodia. The elements in\nMr Yekatom’s group kept the women apart from the male captives but close by, under the\nveranda of Cœur de Lion’s house. Mr Yekatom was not present at Yamwara during the\ngroup’s arrival there or during the said interrogation at Cœur de Lion’s house.\nFollowing the men’s interrogation, the elements in Mr Yekatom’s group forced them to\nundress, searched them again, threatened them with death, and found no weapons on any of\nthem. Upon another search of the captives, an element in Mr Yekatom’s group recovered a\nSIM card in the trousers of one of the female captives and no weapons were found on them.\nThe elements in Mr Yekatom’s group took the women inside Cœur de Lion’s house while\nSaint Cyr’s interrogation continued outside, and from where they could hear what was\nhappening outside. Elements in Mr Yekatom’s group continued to interrogate Saint Cyr and\nbeat him, despite him showing his identification card and insisting that he was a FACA\nmember. Cœur de Lion, who was observing Saint Cyr’s mistreatment, encouraged the\nassailants and ordered them to continue, saying, inter alia, that the victims were ‘Muslims’\nand ‘Seleka’ and to ‘do the job properly’. Elements in Mr Yekatom’s group specifically beat\nSaint Cyr’s legs, breaking them, and tied him up in ‘arbatacher’ manner, continuing to\nassault him. An element in Mr Yekatom’s group cut off Saint Cyr’s toes, fingers, and an ear,\nbeing encouraged by Cœur de Lion’s presence at the scene and his words, and feeling that\nthere was no choice but to do it.

Later, Mr Yekatom told P-1839 that this element had done a ‘good job’ insofar.\nMr Yekatom did not punish this element for these acts and, on the contrary, rewarded this\nelement with posts of responsibility within his group, including as part of his security detail.\nMr Yekatom considered Saint Cyr a ‘traitor’ and ‘in cahoots with the Seleka’ and that\ntherefore, they could not ‘keep him’.

Inside Cœur\nde Lion’s house, the elements in Mr Yekatom’s group forced them to undress to their\nunderwear, searched them again, threatened them with death and kept them in this location.\nAt this time, the female captives could hear the interrogation and mistreatment of Saint Cyr\ntaking place outside. An element in Mr Yekatom’s group pointed a weapon in the women’s\ndirection and asked P-1811 about her tribe. At some point, the female captives could no\nlonger hear Saint Cyr crying outside. During their captivity inside Cœur de Lion’s house,\nelements from Mr Yekatom’s group were going in and out of the house and threatened them\nwith death. Mr Yekatom met the female captives inside Cœur de Lion’s house later that\nevening and introduced himself as ‘Rombhot’ and ‘the chief’. Mr Yekatom interrogated the\nfemale captives about their ethnicities and family background. Mr Yekatom knew that the\nthree women were Muslim.

The female captives had no indication about, or reason to\nbelieve, the genuineness of Mr Yekatom’s composure or the purported efforts to have them\nreleased, nor the possibility that they would be released.

However, he also indicated that re-\nsaving a CDR file by someone who did not produce it would not necessarily corrupt the\ndata.145 In this regard, the Chamber notes the Prosecution’s submission that its CDR were\nobtained through a series of RFAs in text, CSV and Excel formats.146\nGhislain N’Douba further testified on the location of the Moov cell towers, explaining that,\nin Bangui, in 2013 and 2014, the range of relay of the antennas was generally set at 1 to 2\nkilometres in order to avoid interference between them.147 Outside of Bangui, the range can\nreach up to 20 kilometres but may still vary based on geographical and meteorological\nconditions.148 Each cell site may be divided into sectors, each of which has an antenna149 that\ntransmits its signal over a certain area and direction in an attempt to provide the best server\ncoverage.150 The angle or degree at which the antenna on the cell tower is pointed is known\nas an azimuth.151 All companies have information on the areas covered by each antenna, for\nboth technical and commercial reasons.152 Even when not being used, a handset\ncommunicates regularly with the network so that it knows at all times where the telephone\nis located.153 As to cell site items, the Chamber notes Duncan Brown’s evidence that\nnetworks typically maintain a separate cell site information database that will be used for\ncell site planning and should be updated with any changes to the cells or cell sites.154\nThe Chamber further notes that handsets normally connect to the strongest signal that is best\nfor establishing communications,155 and that CDR from all telecommunications companies\n144 P-2973: T-242, p. 21, line 18 – p. 22, line 1, p. 26, lines 17-23.

Furthermore, the Chamber notes that the Ngaïssona Defence questions the\nauthenticity of the Prosecution CDR Material by referring to the lack of factual or expert\ntestimony on the nature, authorship and process by which the CDR were generated.\nHowever, the Chamber is of the view that these submissions appear to concern rather\nwhether the Prosecution CDR Material can be deemed sufficiently reliable or accurate, as\nwell as the manner in which the Chamber may or should interpret them.177 In addition, the\nChamber considers in this instance that the potential disparities in formats of the CDR or the\nfact that some may have been generated for billing, tax or litigation purposes do not have an\nimpact overall on the authenticity of the CDR. In this regard, the Chamber is of the view that\nthese differences do not necessarily mean that some CDR ‘are more genuine’ or more\nauthentic than others.\nMoreover, the Chamber understands from the evidence of Ghislain N’Douba and Duncan\nBrown that CDR and cell site items can be generally presumed reliable, having regard to the\nfact that they contain information that was automatically generated and that their accuracy\nserves the networks’ best interests, the manner in which they were stored and transmitted\nwithout evidence of tampering, and the involvement of persons with sufficient knowledge\nor technical expertise in the production process of the CDR.

In this regard,\nthe Chamber notes that sometimes witnesses provided phone numbers in statements or\nduring testimony, or that phone numbers were discovered as being saved or registered as\n178 See e.g. Annex A.10 to the Ngaïssona Defence Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2736-Conf-AnxA.10.

Given the possibility that different\nregulations or practices concerning the collection of CDR may apply, compared to the CAR, the Chamber cannot\npronounce itself on the authenticity or reliability of CAR-OTP-2103-0675.\n181 See Ngaïssona Defence Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2736-AnxA-Corr-Red, paras 93-120, 125-130.

In certain instances, witnesses\nadmitted or refuted having placed a phone call when confronted with a CDR.183 The\nChamber also understands from the evidence before it that it may have been possible that a\nhandset was shared by more than one person, that a call was made through another phone\nnumber or received by someone else who also had access to that particular handset.\nFurthermore, the Chamber considers that in the event a CDR shows that a call was placed\nbetween individuals, that evidence alone cannot definitively prove that said individuals\neffectively engaged in a conversation. Conversely, an absence of CDR evidence does not\nexclude the possibility that a communication actually took place by other means or devices.\nConsequently, CDR alone also cannot depict with accuracy the frequency of\ncommunications between individuals. Similarly, the length of a call alone is not necessarily\nreflective of a conversation taking place.\nAs to the content of phone calls, CDR themselves do not offer information thereon, but must\nbe read together with the witness’s testimony about said phone call. If no witness provided\nevidence about the existence of a phone call, no conclusion can be drawn on the content by\nsolely relying on the CDR.\nLastly, having regard to the limitations mentioned by Ghislain N’Douba and Duncan Brown\ndiscussed above, the CDR and cell site items alone cannot conclusively show a person’s\nexact geographic location.\nIn light of the above, the Chamber will assess the CDR and cell site items, if at all, on a case-\nby-case basis, depending on the inference sought by the parties, having regard to the totality\nof the evidence before it, as referenced in the following sections of this judgment.\n182 See e.g. P-0808 Statement, CAR-OTP-2093-0010-R02, at 0037, paras 151, 143.\n183 See section IV. below.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 64/1616 24 July 2025",

In the view of the Chamber, such character traits have no meaningful\nrelation with the credibility of the information provided by a witness; they also do not\nindicate a tendency to lie on oath.\nBearing this in mind and having reviewed it in light of the Ngaïssona Defence’s arguments,\nthe Chamber finds that P-0306’s testimony is, nonetheless, generally credible. P-0306 had\nfirsthand information about the participation of his group in the attacks on Bouca and\nBangui, and was forthcoming and appeared sincere about the details of his own involvement.\nP-0306 recognised [REDACTED],207 and explained the contents of this video as well as the\ncharacters featured in it.208\nFurther, the Chamber considers that P-0306 did not show a tendency to incriminate\nMr Ngaïssona at all costs and therefore his testimony did not reflect a bias against\nMr Ngaïssona or the Anti-Balaka generally. For example, when asked how he and his group\narmed, P-0306 did not implicate Mr Ngaïssona in the supply of weapons and described how\nhe obtained his AK-47 and ammunition from the Seleka that he killed.209 P-0306 was also\nclear that he only got to know Mr Ngaïssona as the ‘general coordinator’ when they met in\nBangui in 2014.210 Related to the allegations that Mr Ngaïssona provided money to the\nelements during their advance to Bangui before 5 December 2013, P-0306 said that while\n205 Ngaïssona Defence Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2736-Conf-AnxA-Corr, paras 450-452.\n206 Ngaïssona Defence Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2736-AnxA-Corr-Red, para. 526.\n207 P-0306: T-065, p. 20, line 13 – p. 23, line 15 referring to Video, CAR-OTP-2049-0141.\n208 P-0306: T-065, p. 25, line 14 – p. 27, line 14, p. 28, lines 14-25.\n209 P-0306: T-064, p. 23, line 13 – p. 24, line 24, p. 73, lines 9-24.

For example, P-0306, when asked how many people\naccompanied Konaté [REDACTED], said that they were numerous but that he could not\nprovide ‘a precise figure’ of people.213 P-0306, when asked about the size of his group, said\nthat it was ‘difficult to give […] a number of people who were fighting’.214 P-0306, asked\nabout when his group arrived close to Bangui in 2013, said that they remained there ‘for\nabout a month’ before December but that he could not be ‘very specific as to the date on\nwhich [they] arrived’.215\nNonetheless, the Chamber noted that certain portions of his testimony were not consistent\nwith other evidence received by the Chamber. However, in its view and in any event, these\ninconsistencies were not such that they rendered his testimony wholly unreliable.

In this regard, the Chamber notes that other witnesses testified\nabout the involvement of P-0306’s group in these attacks and that the Chamber was in a\nposition to assess the veracity of the details provided by P-0306. The same was true of the\npurported military instructions by Mr Ngaïssona concerning the attack on Bangui on 5\nDecember 2013.

This did not reflect\nnegatively on the credibility of the rest of his claims; however, they do render these notes\nunreliable for the purposes of drawing any factual conclusions. Accordingly, the Chamber\nhas not relied on the contents of these notes in its evidentiary analysis below.\nFurthermore, in the view of the Chamber, these notes did not reflect improper motives to\nincriminate Mr Ngaïssona nor a fabrication of evidence, or otherwise indicate that P-0306\nwas coached to provide evidence before the Chamber.

For example, when confronted\nwith a document dated December 2013 stating that he was the military coordinator of the\nAnti-Balaka, Joachim Kokaté claimed that his signature had been forged and that he had\nnever seen that document; in relation to another document dated January 2014, purportedly\ndrafted by him, Joachim Kokaté said that he had not seen this document and claimed that it\nwas fraudulent.276 Joachim Kokaté also distanced himself from any involvement with the\nFROCCA and being able to provide information about it, despite his purported association\nwith this movement.277 Similarly, he also appeared to downplay his knowledge of the attack\non Bangui of 5 December 2013.278\nIn the Chamber’s view, neither of these aspects undermined the credibility of the remainder\nof the witness’s testimony. The Chamber has considered it within the context of other\nevidence before it.

He was knowledgeable about the context and political events in the CAR\nduring the relevant period. He directly interacted with Mr Ngaïssona and was generally\nforthcoming about his exchanges with him. The witness appeared to be generally able to\ndistinguish between the sources of his knowledge. For example, he considered that he was\nnot ‘the authorised person’ to talk about Mr Yekatom because all that he could say about\nhim were ‘things that I learned from rumours’.289\nThe Chamber notes that Alfred Legrand Ngaya appeared to present a favourable and passive\nview of Mr Ngaïssona’s role in 2014, which often led him to contradict himself. For\nexample, he stated not being aware that anyone provided money to the Anti-Balaka.290 At\nthe same time, according to him, Mr Ngaïssona supported the Anti-Balaka on his return with\nhis ‘own money’ to dissuade them.291 He did not recall if Mr Ngaïssona provided financial\nresources as requested, but indicated that at some point, Mr Ngaïssona sent money to him to\nhelp the Anti-Balaka in their neighbourhood and dissuade them from bothering the\npopulation.292 He also thought that Mr Ngaïssona was designated as coordinator because the\nAnti-Balaka did not have resources to take care of themselves and Mr Ngaïssona had a\nreputation for being generous with money.293 He also said that Mr Ngaïssona ‘had an\ninfluence on the movement because of his generosity, of doing good’ and that they ‘always\nneeded him’.294\nAlfred Legrand Ngaya also did not appear forthcoming as regards his email exchanges with\nMr Ngaïssona. In places, he denied what is apparent from the clear text of the emails\nexchanged between him and Mr Ngaïssona in July and August 2013 that concern organising\nmilitary actions.295 For example, he explained in relation to these emails that they had spoken\non the phone two or three times while Mr Ngaïssona was in exile in Cameroon in 2013 and\n289 P-0808: T-072, p. 47, line 10 – p. 48, line 9; see also p. 50, line 16 – p. 51, line 15.\n290 P-0808 First Statement, CAR-OTP-2025-0324-R05, at 0332, para. 55.\n291 P-0808 Second Statement, CAR-OTP-2093-0010-R02, at 0023, para. 71; P-0808: T-071, p. 45, lines 16-25.\n292 P-0808: T-069, p. 19, lines 1-12.\n293 P-0808: T-070, p. 42, line 17 – p. 43, line 9, p. 58, line 23 – p. 59, line 5.\n294 P-0808: T-071, p. 27, lines 7-16.\n295 See e.g. Email, CAR-OTP-2130-3288, at 3288, 3289-90; Email, CAR-OTP-2130-3291; Email, CAR-OTP-2130-\n3294; Email, CAR-OTP-2130-3296; Email, CAR-OTP-2130-3297; Email, CAR-OTP-2130-3298.

The Chamber is of the view that Jean-Jacques Demafouth was generally clearly\ncapable of differentiating in his answers between the sources of information and his own\ninterpretation.

There were crimes that were committed in my country.\nAnd I told the investigators of the OTP the first day when we met, my wish is that the perpetrators of these crimes be\npunished.

While P-0954 claims to have\npersonally interacted with Mr Yekatom over the telephone during the relevant time, he\nappears to have qualified these interactions by distinguishing between what he had heard\nand what he assumed. The Chamber particularly noted that P-0954 himself also did not claim\nto have direct or accurate information about the events when providing information about\nwhat he did not experience himself. This reflected positively on the reliability of his\ntestimony.\nNonetheless, the Chamber has borne in mind the source of his information when assessing\nthe weight to be given to his evidence. This applies to P-0954’s evidence concerning the\narming and financing of Mr Yekatom’s group,380 as well as his testimony concerning his\nphone call with Mr Yekatom regarding the events that took place at Yamwara on and around\n24 December 2013.\nAs regards the Yekatom Defence’s arguments, the Chamber finds that P-0954’s evidence\nreflected a degree of animosity towards Mr Yekatom.

For example,\nthe witness described one incident in which Mr Yekatom [REDACTED].383\nFurther, the Chamber notes that P-0954’s statement and his in-court testimony are\ninconsistent concerning Mr Ngaïssona financing the Anti-Balaka. In his interview with the\nProsecution, P-0954 stated that ‘N[gaïssona], M[okom] […] and Francis B[ozizé] financed\nthe A[nti-Balaka] to buy weapons and ammunition’.384 When asked about this statement in\ncourt, P-0954 said that Mr Ngaïssona’s name was ‘perhaps an error’ and, when asked, agreed\nthat information in this statement as regards Mr Ngaïssona concerned ‘[REDACTED]’,\nadding that he did not know what Mr Ngaïssona was doing in Cameroon and did not ‘hear\nhis name in relation to the financing in 2013’.385 In the view of the Chamber, P-0954\ndownplayed Mr Ngaïssona’s role during his in-court testimony but this did not impact the\ncredibility of the remainder of the evidence he provided.\nHaving regard to the above, the Chamber also considers the Yekatom Defence’s allegation\nthat P-0954 gave a false account [REDACTED] to be speculative.

His testimony about Carnot\nand Berbérati does not directly relate to any of the charged incidents in this case.\nAs set out below, the Chamber concludes that his evidence concerning a key aspect relevant\nfor this case – whether Anti-Balaka elements made a distinction between the Seleka and\nMuslims – was not forthcoming and therefore, not reliable.

Notably, in court, when asked about\nhis previous statement that ‘when I find a Muslim I’m going to kill him’, Chrysostome\nYapélé explained that ‘they’ did not want to kill Muslims but the Seleka because ‘there was\n408 Decision on the Appointment of Duty Counsel, ICC-01/14-01/18-857; Notification of the Appointment of Mr Jacob\nSangone as Legal Adviser to Witness P-1077, 12 August 2022, ICC-01/14-01/18-1543 (with confidential Annexes I\nand II).\n409 P-1077 Interview Transcripts, CAR-OTP-2107-3366-R01; CAR-OTP-2107-3394-R01; CAR-OTP-2107-3396-\nR01; CAR-OTP-2107-3428-R01; CAR-OTP-2107-3454-R01; CAR-OTP-2107-3483-R01; CAR-OTP-2107-3500-\nR01; CAR-OTP-2107-3530-R01; CAR-OTP-2107-3554-R01; CAR-OTP-2107-3584-R01; CAR-OTP-2107-3610-\nR01; CAR-OTP-2107-3636-R01; CAR-OTP-2107-3666-R01; and its associated items, CAR-OTP-2083-0130; CAR-\nOTP-2083-0131; CAR-OTP-2083-0132; CAR-OTP-2001-4257; CAR-OTP-2003-1654, at 1736; CAR-OTP-2030-\n0248; CAR-OTP-2030-0445; CAR-OTP-2030-2280; CAR-OTP-2107-6899; CAR-OTP-2107-7027; CAR-OTP-\n2059-0026; CAR-OTP-2066-1601, at 1655-57; CAR-OTP-2020-0413; Fourteenth Decision on the Prosecution\nRequests for Formal Submission of Prior Recorded Testimonies under Rule 68(3) of the Rules concerning Witnesses\nP-2556 and P-1077, 14 June 2022, ICC-01/14-01/18-1457, para. 28, p. 12; P-1077: T-149, p. 9, lines 9-11.\n410 See e.g. Ngaïssona Defence Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2736-AnxA-Corr-Red, paras 232-233.\n411 See e.g. Ngaïssona Defence Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2736-AnxA-Corr-Red, para. 256.\n412 Ngaïssona Defence Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2736-AnxA-Corr-Red, para. 256.

The Chamber notes that there are indeed some discrepancies between P-\n1339’s prior statement and his testimony. For example, P-1339’s recollection that P-1839\nand Stéphane Chrisostome Dawili were in Mr Yekatom’s group prior to 5 December 2013\ndoes not match their respective testimonies that they joined only after 5 December 2013\nwhen Mr Yekatom’s group was stationed at Yamwara.443 The Chamber considers these\ninconsistencies immaterial and, in any event, understandable given the passage of time.\nSimilarly, the Chamber notes that P-1339’s account of when and how exactly he assumed\nthe [REDACTED] in Mr Yekatom’s group is unclear. In the view of the Chamber, this did\nnot discredit P-1339’s remaining testimony, nor the fact that he did, at some point in 2013,\n[REDACTED].\nFurther, the Chamber is of the view that P-1339 showed a genuine disposition to answer the\nquestions put to him truthfully, and did not hesitate to correct himself or admit that he had\nmade a mistake when pointed out to him. The Chamber found his explanations in this regard\ngenerally reasonable and credible. The Chamber considers that these discrepancies did not\nrender his testimony wholly unreliable.\nIn addition, given his being part of Mr Yekatom’s group, the Chamber notes that the witness\nwas forthcoming about the words and actions of Mr Yekatom and Habib Beina.444 For\nexample, he clearly distinguished between acts committed by Mr Yekatom’s group or the\nAnti-Balaka movement and others, such as the local population.445\n441 Yekatom Defence Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2737-Corr-Red, paras 115-133.\n442 Yekatom Defence Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2737-Corr-Red, para. 134.\n443 See also paragraph 3043 below.\n444 See e.g. P-1339: T-155, p. 49, line 17 – p. 56, lines 23 referring to Video, CAR-OTP-2065-0436; T-160, p. 6,\nlines 3-22, p. 8, line 5 – p. 9, line 3, p. 51, lines 7-15.\n445 See e.g. P-1339: T-152, p. 71, line 17 – p. 72, line 5, p. 74, lines 10-20.

The Chamber notes that this concerns instructions coming from Yaoundé, which he\nmentioned during his testimony.483 In the Chamber’s view, P-1719 adequately explained\nwhy he only mentioned this in court. Indeed, P-1719 said that what prompted him to mention\nit was that the ‘personalities’, who were ‘part of the general staff’ and who are mentioned in\nhis prior statement, ‘were in permanent coordination with Yaoundé’, although he clarified\nthat he did not receive any instructions directly ‘from the authority’.484 The Chamber is of\nthe view that the witness was simply providing a further clarification to his prior statement\nand that the fact that he only mentioned Yaoundé in court does not affect the credibility of\nthis account.\nHaving regard to the above, the Chamber concludes that P-1719’s testimony is generally\ncredible. The Chamber has considered it within the context of other evidence before it.\nviii.

The Chamber did not consider this evidence unique in that others like him, including\nFACA members, testified about the events starting from the formation of Anti-Balaka groups\nin Gobere and their participation in the attack on Bangui on 5 December 2013. In the view\nof the Chamber, P-2269 appeared forthcoming and truthful about his own involvement in\nthe Anti-Balaka and his actions in 2013. P-2269’s account was largely internally consistent,\nand he was able to explain the differences in his interview with the Prosecution sufficiently.\nAs regards the Ngaïssona Defence’s arguments, the Chamber found that none of them\nindividually or taken together discredited the entirety of P-2269’s testimony. Turning to\nspecific inconsistencies raised by it, the Chamber considered that those regarding P-2269’s\npresence in Gobere were minor and did not throw into question the fact that he himself was\npresent there. This is particularly supported by the detailed account P-2269 provided on the\nbase set up in Gobere, the different groups present there and the activities they carried out.628\nSimilarly, the Ngaïssona Defence’s arguments concerning the list provided by P-2269 and\n626 Ngaïssona Defence Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2736-AnxA-Corr-Red, para. 216.\n627 Yekatom Defence Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2737-Corr-Red, para. 220, n. 740 referring to Third Rule\n68(2)(c) Decision, ICC-01/14-01/18-2127-Red, paras 25, 36.

P-2673 was also clear about which events he experienced\nhimself, and distinguished own experiences from matters he heard from others, often\nspecifying sources of the information he received.

In particular, the Chamber finds that the witness downplayed the\nfrequency and nature of his interactions with Mr Ngaïssona in Douala and thereafter in the\nCAR. At the same time, the witness also overemphasised Mr Ngaïssona’s involvement in\nfootball-related activities at the time, admitting either not knowing or having heard about\nMr Ngaïssona’s involvement in anything but football-related activities during the relevant\ntime.684 In the view of the Chamber, the witness’s claims, in and of themselves, are highly\nimprobable and contradicted by other evidence before it.\nFor example, in his statement, Brice Stanislas Mohi said that in Douala, he would see\nMr Ngaïssona ‘often’, one or two times per month, including on Saturdays, during the\nweekend.685 In court, asked about his visits to Mr Ngaïssona, the witness said that they did\nnot take place often and that ‘[s]ometimes’, he would go there on Saturday or Sunday, if\nthere was nothing to do at home.686\nFurthermore, in court, Brice Stanislas Mohi claimed that in his interactions with\nMr Ngaïssona, they did not ‘speak about what had happened in the country’ and that they\nwould speak ‘a lot more about football’ and ‘sometimes’ watch matches together.687 Brice\nStanislas Mohi, when asked, said that he never had a conversation with Mr Ngaïssona about\npeople going back from Cameroon to the CAR to ‘rise in revolt’.688 He said that Mr\nNgaïssona was not a member of the Anti-Balaka and was ‘much more interested in\nfootball’.689 The witness said that, at the time, ‘all Central Africans’, including himself, had\nheard about the Anti-Balaka movement but that he never saw Mr Ngaïssona participate in it\nand only knew him as the president of the football federation.690 Brice Stanislas Mohi also\nsaid that during his interactions with Mr Ngaïssona in 2013, he ‘never heard’ that Mr\nNgaïssona supported those who wanted to go back to the country and fight, and repeated that\n684 See e.g. D30-4504 Statement, CAR-D30-0023-0001, at 0005, paras 18, 20, 36, 40-41.\n685 D30-4504: Statement, CAR-D30-0023-0001-R02, at 0003, para. 18.\n686 D30-4504: T-283, p. 24, line 21 – p. 25, line 4.\n687 D30-4504: T-283, p. 28, line 17 – p. 29, line 9.\n688 D30-4504: T-283, p. 28, line 25 – p. 29, line 3.\n689 D30-4504: T-283, p. 29, lines 4-9.\n690 D30-4504: T-283, p. 29, lines 10-14.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 142/1616 24 July 2025",

For example, Didier\nOuebio indicated that all the information he had was ‘based on rumours’713 and although the\nmessages included very specific information regarding attacks, he answered that they were\nmere references to ‘terms [they] used when playing cards’.714 Further, while acknowledging\nthat the term ‘le patron’ mentioned in his messages referred to François Bozizé, Didier\nOuebio repeatedly said that those actions indicated by ‘le patron’ did not come from François\nBozizé but from Didier Ouebio himself.715 The Chamber also considered unreasonable his\n‘spiritual position’ that with the reference to ‘nos hommes’, ‘our men’, he meant ‘those who\nwere not the Seleka’.716\nHaving regard to the above, the Chamber has assessed the veracity of Didier Ouebio’s claims\nand opinions in light of other evidence received.\n710 See e.g. D30-4679: T-299, p. 45, lines 13-21; T-301, p. 31, lines 2-15.\n711 D30-4679: T-301, p. 11, line 6 – p. 12, line 17.\n712 D30-4679: T-299, p. 49, line 2 – p. 51, line 18 (while initially denying that François Bozizé organised meetings at\nthe Cité du Golf, Didier Ouebio later acknowledged that he was not present in the meetings and was not in a position\nto know about them).\n713 D30-4679: T-300, p. 28, line 22 – p. 33, line 19 referring to Facebook messages, CAR-OTP-2132-1004.\n714 D30-4679: T-300, p. 12, line 23 – p. 14, line 17 referring to Facebook messages, CAR-OTP-2132-6648.\n715 D30-4679: T-300, p. 14, line 19 – p. 25, line 12 referring to Facebook messages, CAR-OTP-2131-3310.

For\nexample, there is no contradiction in P-2658’s testimony about Dedane having a group and\ntravelling by motorbike786 and Dedane, or the Anti-Balaka, entertaining anti-Muslim\nsentiment.

In the view of the Chamber by majority, Judge\nChung dissenting, these inconsistencies are irreconcilable with his remaining account and\nother evidence before the Chamber, namely, the length of time he spent in Mr Yekatom’s\ngroup, when and how he joined it, and observing Cœur de Lion’s role and actions in relation\nto Mbaïki and Boda.\nJudge Chung considers that these inconsistencies were of a minor nature, especially given\nP-2476’s age at the time of the events and his own admission that he was too young at the\ntime to remember all the details correctly.871\nThe majority appreciates that P-2476 did not need to remember all the details having to do\nwith his experience in Mr Yekatom’s group coherently and consistently, especially given his\npurported age at the time. However, in the view of the majority, the inconsistencies in his\ntestimony were crucial to his account as an alleged child soldier, and such that the majority\nwas unable to resolve the bold claims made by P-2476 about Cœur de Lion’s actions with\nhis inability to place himself in time in relation to the latter’s death. The same held true for\nthe amount of time that P-2476 allegedly spent in Mr Yekatom’s group.\nThe Chamber notes that P-2476 would have arrived in Mbaïki somewhere in mid-2013.872\nP-2476 said that he did not remember the exact date that he joined the Anti-Balaka and met\nwith Cœur de Lion, but claimed that this was before the Muslims were evacuated from\nMbaïki,873 which took place at the earliest on or around 6 February 2014, and later agreed\nthat it was after the Muslim evacuation.874 P-2476 stated that he joined the group in the spirit\nof revenge against the death of his ‘cousin’ at the hands of the Seleka.875 During the\n871 P-2476: T-214, p. 10, lines 9-13.\n872 P-2476 Statement, CAR-OTP-2114-0149-R05, at 0152, para. 18; P-2476: T-213, p. 57, line 6 – p. 58, line 5.

On 23 February 2024, the Chamber rejected a request by the Yekatom Defence for an order\nto have the CLRV1 Witnesses’ phones handed over to a competent third party for forensic examination (see Decision\non the CLRV1 and Yekatom Defence Requests following the VWU Report on V45-0001 and V45-0002, 23 February\n2024, ICC-01/14-01/18-2376-Conf (public redacted version notified on 17 May 2024, ICC-01/14-01/18-2376-Red)).\nOn 17 May 2024, the Chamber rejected the Yekatom Defence’s request to order the VWU to facilitate a limited\ninspection by the Yekatom Defence of V45-0002’s phone ([REDACTED]) in order to identify and examine the latter’s\ncommunications with P-2580 during a specific period (see Decision on the Yekatom Defence Request for a Limited\nInspection of Material Obtained by the VWU, 17 May 2024, ICC-01/14-01/18-2496-Conf).

V45-0001’s victim application form and the\ndeclaration of identity contained therein state that his date of birth is [REDACTED] 2002.920\nAsked whether he had told [REDACTED], the person who took down the information to fill\nthe victim application form, his date of birth, V45-0001 said that he had told this person that\nhe was born on [REDACTED] 2003.921 When confronted with the dates as they appear on\nhis victim application form, V45-0001 said that he did not know a lot about it because he\nhad indicated that it was [REDACTED] 2003 and his statement was not read back to him\nafter they took it and perhaps that is where the problem came from.922\nSecond, it is unclear how the information concerning the time of birth as included in the\nreconstituted birth certificate was obtained and why it appears on this document. V45-0001,\nwhen asked, did not know the time of his birth.923 V45-0001, read out a document which\nprovides an hour of birth,924 and asked where this information came from, said that this\ninformation was featured in another birth certificate which did not have a counterfoil; he said\n918 Decision, CAR-V45-00000005.\n919 V45-0001: T-245, p. 42, line 19 – p. 43, line 4.\n920 Application form, CAR-V45-00000004, at 004.\n921 V45-0001: T-246, p. 36, lines 2-6.\n922 V45-0001: T-246, p. 36, lines 7-15.\n923 V45-0001: T-246, p. 15, line 24 – p. 16, line 2.\n924 Judgement, CAR-V45-00000005.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 171/1616 24 July 2025",

Asked about this difference, V45-0001 said that [REDACTED] did not read\nback to him his account when interviewing him for the victim application form.997 V45-0001\ndid agree that it was incorrect that Sartana handed him the bullets; according to V45-0001,\nif [REDACTED] had read out what he had written down, they would have realised this\nmistake, but unfortunately he did not.998 The Chamber considers it unlikely that the victim\napplication form would omit mention of Mr Yekatom’s actions had he mentioned them to\nwhoever was taking down the notes, and instead would have recorded a completely different\nname.\nSimilarly, V45-0001’s victim application form mentions two bullets which states that he\nkept until the date on which he filled out the form,999 while during his testimony, V45-0001\nsaid that Mr Yekatom gave him the bullets once, one to him and one to another person, and\n993 Certificate, CAR-V45-00000012.

Given the Chamber’s conclusions about his identity, it is equally unable to believe\nV45-0001’s account concerning his alleged membership in the Anti-Balaka.

When asked how many\npeople died in Boda, V45-0002 first said that many people died, then that only one person\ndied, which was their ComZone Cœur de Lion.1074 Further, V45-0002’s victim application\nform suggests that he joined the Anti-Balaka in March 2014 and that Cœur de Lion made\nhim [REDACTED] in Boda,1075 while other evidence on the record shows that the attack on\nBoda took place in early February 2014, and that Cœur de Lion was killed therein.1076 When\nconfronted with the contradictions concerning Boda, V45-0002 simply maintained that he\nwas in the Anti-Balaka group led by Cœur de Lion.1077\nThird, V45-0002’s account that he participated in the ESF programme contains significant\ndiscrepancies.

In this respect, the Chamber further\nrecalls with emphasis that the ESF programme was intended for children under the ages of\n18 years. In the view of the Chamber, this age bracket was forensically irrelevant in the\ncontext of this case, and thus the Prosecution’s reliance on P-2018’s testimony and the ESF\nprogramme is largely irrelevant for purposes of discharging its burden of proof.\nTurning now to the reliability of P-2018’s handwritten notes of meetings,1160 the Chamber\nnotes that P-2018 also claimed to have met Mr Yekatom on two occasions, first in Mbaïki\nand then afterwards in Pissa.1161 As regards the first meeting, P-2018 said that he told\nMr Yekatom ‘everything regarding the presence of the children’, including ‘about the\ndifferent age ranges’,1162 and discussed with him the definition of a child and what the\nUNICEF considers.1163 P-2018 mentioned that Mr Yekatom himself confirmed that indeed\nthere were children within the group and that those children played different roles;\nMr Yekatom also said that he would proceed with the liberation or release of those\nchildren.1164\nP-2018 appears to be sole witness on Mr Yekatom’s presence at these meeting, one of which\nhe did not mention during his interview with the Prosecution,1165 namely the second meeting\n1158 P-2018: T-226, p. 20, lines 5-12.\n1159 P-2018: T-224, p. 84, line 21 – p. 85, line 10.

For example, P-2018 denied that the children\nreceived a sum of money after the ESF programme ended and then said that he did not know\nif there was any money that was given to each individual child.1176 While the Chamber has\nfound P-2475 and P-2476 to be not reliable as further outlined above, with Judge Chung\ndissenting in respect of P-2476, it notes that both indicated that they were given money at\nthe end of their training.1177 D29-6035 stated that at the end of the training, a vehicle came\nto his house in Bangui and brought the three children related to him with a sum of money\nfor each of them.1178 In another example, P-2018 testified not being able to remember the\ndetails of the children when confronted with his prior statement in which he talked about\nthem.1179\nHaving regard to this, the Chamber finds P-2018 not credible when it comes to assessing the\nasserted ages of the individuals on the ESF List, specifically when it concerns children under\nthe age of 15 years, and has therefore not solely relied on his testimony in this aspect.

Due to his\nposition at the time, the witness was knowledgeable about the duties and responsibilities of\nthe civil status authorities in Pissa and was able to provide the contextual information needed\nto appreciate how these authorities were functioning during the relevant period.

In particular, Roger Okoa-Penguia said that he would not\nfirst check that the archives do not have another birth certificate for the same person when\nreceiving a supplementary judgment; that in Bangui, there are people who make the mayors’\nstamps and who, on occasion, buy registers and make transcriptions which are fraudulent;\nand that what is of interest to them (‘us’) is the stamp of the president of the court, the initials\nfrom the president of the court, which means it is genuine.1211\nThe Chamber notes that there is indeed evidence from Alexandre Kouroupe-Awo suggesting\nthat someone in Roger Okoa-Penguia’s town hall may have been operating an ‘ad hoc’ birth\nregister, despite Roger Okoa-Penguia’s claims otherwise.1212 Alexandre Kouroupe-Awo\ntestified that Roger Okoa-Penguia was the president of the special delegation within the Pissa\n1206 See e.g. P-2084: T-233, p. 28, line 16 – p. 38, line 9; T-235, p. 25, line 21 – p. 26, line 1, p. 95, lines 2-11.\n1207 See e.g. Prosecution Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2738-Conf, paras 491, 507, 708, 762, 805.\n1208 Annex A to the Yekatom Defence Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2737-Conf-AnxA, pp. 152-153.\n1209 Ngaïssona Defence Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2736-Conf-AnxA-Corr, n. 2061.\n1210 P-2084: T-233, p. 47, lines 13-19.\n1211 P-2084: T-233, p. 47, line 20 – p. 48, line 11.\n1212 The Chamber considered that ‘ad hoc’ registers were defined by P-1813 as those registers that are sometimes held\nby some individuals or staff of the town hall who may use those registers in parallel to issue certificates for their own\ninterests.

FACTUAL FINDINGS AND EVIDENTIARY ANALYSIS\nThe Chamber sets out below its assessment of the evidence submitted and discussed before\nit at trial with respect to each of the findings of fact identified above in Section II (‘Findings\nof fact’). In particular, the Chamber details below the evidence which supports each of those\nfindings of fact, and explains how any such finding was reached in light of the available\nevidence – and the arguments made at trial – both in support of and against that particular\nfinding, as appropriate. This also includes instances when findings on the facts and\ncircumstances described in the charges are reached by way of inference – thus, through facts\nwhich are of ‘intermediate’ or ‘subsidiary’ nature – on the basis of circumstantial evidence.\nAt the same time, the Chamber clarifies that while it structures its discussion below\ndelineating its analysis of evidence with respect to each individual finding of fact, evidence\nmay be relevant to more than one factual finding even if not necessarily reiterated in each\ninstance, and all evidence submitted and discussed before it at trial has been considered\nholistically.\nA.

Michel Djotodia became the leader\nof the Seleka.\nAt the outset, the Chamber considers it of import to briefly outline some of the evidence\nillustrating events and circumstances providing the background to the crisis in the CAR\nduring the period relevant to the charges. While this is not to provide a fully exhaustive\naccount of events, the Chamber is of the view that some understanding of the context leads\nto a better understanding of the events directly relevant to the charges.\nAs aptly put by Catherine Samba-Panza, the former president of transition of the CAR,1221\nit is important ‘to realise that the [CAR] has been experiencing political instability for 30\nyears and […] had a number of crises – a political crisis, social crisis, military/political crisis\n– [which] weakened the state considerably and have caused problems within the people in\nterms of social cohesion and national cohesion’.1222\nSeveral witnesses provided evidence on this background to the crisis in the CAR, with\nTenebaye Massalbaye mentioning that the successive mutinies in the CAR eventually led to\nFrançois Bozizé taking power in a coup in 2003 with the support of the Chadian army.1223\nThis is echoed by Joachim Kokaté, appointed in February 2014 as special advisor for\ndisarmament, demobilisation, and reintegration (hereinafter: ‘DDR’),1224 who testified that\nthey had information that François Bozizé had been accompanied by Chadian soldiers in his\n2003 coup against Ange-Félix Patassé,1225 leading later to violence by such Chadian\nelements and an uprising thereagainst.1226 The individuals supporting François Bozizé in his\ncoup were often referred to as ‘liberators’.1227\n1221 See paragraphs 1561-1562 below.\n1222 P-0952: T-249, p. 6, lines 4-11. The Chamber notes that the CAR Panel of Experts similarly concluded that the\nconflict which broke out in 2012 and culminated in the overthrow of François Bozizé on 24 March 2013 was the most\nrecent escalation in a series of crises that the country experienced over 40 years.

Specifically, Nicolas Tiangaye, former\nprime minister of the CAR,1228 testified that he and others in the opposition contested the\n2011 election results and created a movement calling for an annulment and re-organisation\nof the elections.1229 According to Nicolas Tiangaye, this seizure of power and management\nof the country’s assets created conditions for violence and the rebellion by the Seleka.1230\nThe panel of experts on the CAR set up pursuant to a UN Security Council resolution1231\n(the ‘CAR Panel’) similarly noted a deep fragmentation of the political landscape, combined\nwith increased activities of a multitude of rebel groups that took control over large parts of\nthe territory.1232 Adrien Poussou, a journalist who was also, inter alia, minister for\ncommunication, national reconciliation and civic and democratic culture between November\n2013 and February 2014,1233 opined that after the 2011 elections, the regime brought in close\nfamily members and others close to François Bozizé, while the opposition was sidelined.1234\nP-1193 testified that he initially supported François Bozizé who came like a ‘saviour’, but\nlater individuals who were not of Gbaya ethnicity were ignored by François Bozizé1235 and\nnumerous people, such as Muslims from Ndélé, Birao and Bira, were excluded under\nFrançois Bozizé’s regime.1236 This is similarly reflected in P-0475’s evidence, who stated\nthat François Bozizé as president did not have good relations with the Muslims and when\n1228 See paragraph 694 below.\n1229 P-0291 Statement, CAR-OTP-2024-0036-R05, at 0041, para. 22.

The witness described a specific\nincident and the specific individuals involved, in her observation. She did not provide evidence on Levy Yakété,\nCOCORA or the links of either with François Bozizé in this regard, and merely mentioned in the context of this\nincident that her neighbourhood also knew self-defence groups that protected houses against looting (see D30-4720:\nT-280, p. 33, line 8 – p. 37, line 24). The Chamber notes that the Ngaïssona Defence also points to Facebook chat\nmessages exchanged between user name ‘[REDACTED]’ and user name ‘[REDACTED]’, with the latter posting a\nmessage on 23 November 2013 at 14:41:48 mentioning, inter alia, that [REDACTED] created COCORA not to defend\none man, but rather a country and a people, that [REDACTED] did so without asking François Bozizé’s permission\nand did not benefit from his support (‘je n’ai bénéficié en aucun cas de sa caution, bien au contraire’) (see Facebook\nmessenger chat, CAR-OTP-2101-7105, at 7112). In the Chamber’s view, this does not contradict its conclusion that\nthere were links between Levy Yakété and François Bozizé or that COCORA had the aim of defending the then-\nincumbent regime. That in another Facebook chat message, user name ‘[REDACTED]’ on 4 November 2013 at\n13:05:32, in exchange with user name ‘[REDACTED]’, stated that [REDACTED] in Cameroon, the president would\nhave called [REDACTED] only once ‘pour [REDACTED] reprocher le fait que [REDACTED] confirmé sur RFI le\nfait que les anti-balaka se revendiquaient de lui’ (see Facebook messenger chat, CAR-OTP-2100-9923, at 9926, as\nalso referenced in Defence Response to the “Prosecution’s Seventh Application for the Submission of Evidence from\nthe Bar Table” ICC-01/14-01/18-1874-Conf, 21 July 2023, ICC-01/14-01/18-1999-Conf, paras 17-18) does similarly\nnot distract from this conclusion.\n1343 P-2328: T-046, p. 61, lines 8-20.\n1344 P-2328: T-046, p. 56, lines 12-21.\n1345 P-0884: T-054, p. 35, lines 7-18.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 224/1616 24 July 2025",

However, the\nChamber does not consider this to diminish its conclusion, in particular in light of the other evidence before it, and\nbearing in mind the way in which witnesses seemed to have understood being ‘armed’ in this context as referring to\nfirearms. Similarly, the Chamber recalls that P-1847 denied during his in-court testimony that youth at COCORA\ncheckpoints would have been armed with knives and machetes (see P-1847: T-023, p. 5, line 23 – p. 7, line 11), a\nstatement unequivocally included in his prior recorded testimony introduced pursuant to Rule 68(2)(d) of the Rules\n(P-1847 Second Statement, CAR-OTP-2122-8251-R01, at 8270-71, para. 182.

It\nalso appears from the evidence outlined below that this arrival was welcomed at least by\nparts of the population who thought the Seleka would bring about a desired change.\nNicolas Tiangaye testified that on 22 March 2013, Seleka elements crossed the demarcation\nline in Damara and advanced towards Bangui, passing the Bossembélé axis where they\nsuccessfully procured a significant number of weapons.1386 He stated that another ‘army’\ncame from Bossembélé and on 24 March 2013, these two groups united their forces at\n1382 P-0291 Statement, CAR-OTP-2024-0036-R05, at 0045-46, para. 58; P-0291: T-051, p. 16, line 16 – p. 17, line 20.\n1383 P-2625: T-188, p. 43, line 16 – p. 44, line 1.\n1384 See paragraphs 1276-1280 below.\n1385 See paragraphs 1281 below.\n1386 P-0291 Statement, CAR-OTP-2024-0036-R05, at 0047, para. 67, at 0047-48, para. 70; Investigator’s report, CAR-\nOTP-2034-0002-R02; P-0291: T-051, p. 76, lines 9-16.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 230/1616 24 July 2025",

The Seleka violence\nAfter the Seleka took control of Bangui on 24 March 2013, they committed violence and\nabuses in various localities across the CAR, in particular against individuals considered to\nbe associated with François Bozizé, his Gbaya ethnic group, his government’s security forces,\nand non-Muslims. Mr Ngaïssona’s properties in Bangui were looted. However, the Muslim\ncivilian population was not entirely spared from this violence.\nThe Seleka included fighters in particular from Chad and Sudan. It was led by Central\nAfrican Muslims. Due to the violence and abuses committed by the Seleka and in light of its\nperceived composition, tensions in particular between Muslim and non-Muslim communities\nincreased.\nThe Chamber has received a significant amount of evidence concerning the violence\ncommitted by members of the Seleka following the take-over of Bangui, in the city itself and\nother locations across the CAR territory. That the Seleka committed abuses following their\ntake-over of Bangui is indeed not disputed between the parties.1410 It transpires from the\nevidence before the Chamber that, certainly at the outset, the violence targeted in particular\nsupporters of the former regime or individuals perceived to be so, including members of the\nregular armed forces, including FACA, police and gendarmerie, members of the Gbaya\nethnic group, or inhabitants of neighbourhoods and areas in which supporters of François\nBozizé were generally thought to be living.\nCatherine Samba-Panza testified that once the Seleka entered Bangui, they committed many\nacts of violence and abuse, theft, as well as destroyed public and private property, and\nreligious buildings.1411 The witness agreed with the suggestion that the Seleka targeted non-\nMuslims, particularly Gbaya and people suspected of being close to François Bozizé, and\nthat many people deemed close to François Bozizé were in Boy-Rabe, which was regularly\nattacked by the Seleka.1412 Catherine Samba-Panza stated that the Seleka thought that the\n1409 P-2625: T-188, p. 64, line 16 – p. 65, line 14.

Overall, it is clear\nfrom this evidence and the evidence outlined below1445 that at the latest by October 2013,\nthe situation in the CAR had reached such a state that the UN Security Council expressed\nconcerns about violations of international humanitarian law and human rights in particular\nby Seleka elements and also other armed groups, demanding that all Seleka and other armed\ngroups immediately lay down their arms.1446\nIn the context of the Seleka violence, it is of import for the determinations of the Chamber\nto analyse the impact of such abuses on the CAR communities. In this regard, the Chamber\nturns to the composition of the Seleka and proportion of foreign elements within it, which is\ndiscussed by numerous witnesses.1447\nThe Ngaïssona Defence argues that Sudanese and Chadian mercenaries formed the backbone\nof the Seleka forces and that mercenaries were the ‘overwhelming majority’ within the\nSeleka.1448\n1444 P-0884: T-054, p. 52, lines 3-9 (specified that while the Seleka initially attacked Gbaya, they later committed\ncrimes against other ethnic groups); P-2393 Statement, CAR-OTP-2108-0140-R03, at 0147, para. 39 (said that the\nSeleka in Carnot did not spare anybody and harassed Muslims and Christians alike); P-2389 Statement, CAR-OTP-\n2104-0033-R03, at 0036, para. 19; P-2389: T-238, p. 20, lines 20-25 (stated that the behaviour of the Seleka in Pissa\nwas not good and targeted the whole community, though they were more brutal towards the Christians); P-2353\nStatement, CAR-OTP-2100-0226-R03, at 0228, para. 15, at 0229, para. 19 (stated that the Seleka in Mbaïki treated\nthe Muslim community as harshly as the Christian community).

It appears that the ‘Mission de consolidation de la paix de la Communauté économique des États de\nl’Afrique centrale en République centrafricaine’ (MICOPAX) with its military component FOMAC, set up in 2008,\nwas replaced by the ‘Mission internationale de soutien à la Centrafrique sous conduite africaine’ (MISCA) starting\nin July 2013 (see AU Press release, CAR-D29-0002-0668; Press article, CAR-D29-0002-0690, at 0692-93; Press\narticle, CAR-D29-0002-0656; UNHCHR Report, CAR-OTP-2001-0172, at 0176, para. 12; HRW Report, CAR-OTP-\n2001-1870, at 1885). Given the deployment of various international or internationalised forces in the CAR over\nprolonged periods, the Chamber considers this confusion of terms to be understandable and will refer to the acronyms\nas they were used in witness testimony, with the understanding that this may not necessarily accurately refer to the\nforce in fact operating at the respective time.\n1465 P-0291: T-052-ENG, p. 33, line 22 – p. 34, line 11; T-052-FRA, p. 36, line 11 – p. 37, line 1; D30-4514 Statement,\nCAR-D30-0025-0001-R01, at 0024-25, lines 779-795; P-1813 First Statement, CAR-OTP-2069-0035-R02, at 0043,\npara. 53; P-1813: T-182, p. 22, line 23 – p. 23, line 11; P-0801: T-037, p. 41, line 25 – p. 42, line 4; D29-5013: T-285,\np. 21, line 12 – p. 22, line 15; P-0992 Second Statement, CAR-OTP-2128-0288-R02, at 0291, para. 20; P-1193: T-\n126, p. 15, line 8 – p. 16, line 5.

Further, the Chamber notes in this regard that the evidence of P-2673 on\nMr Ngaïssona, Bernard Mokom and also Wapounaba and Sosthène staying in one residence\nis supported by the information given by Alfred Legrand Ngaya outlined above, who testified\nto visiting Mr Ngaïssona, being picked up by Bernard Mokom for this purpose, and in the\nend having dinner with Mr Ngaïssona, Sosthène and also others.\nFurther in this context, the Chamber considers to be unreliable P-1847’s denial of\nMr Ngaïssona ever having stayed at the Golf residence, or Mr Ngaïssona meeting François\nBozizé there while the latter still lived at this residence. The witness’s answers in court on\nthese matters were directly contradictory to the information in his prior recorded\ntestimony,1747 with the witness providing deflective and evasive answers when asked about\nsuch contradictions.1748\nAt the same time, what the witness did maintain in court was telling: P-1847 stated that Levy\nYakété participated in meetings at the Golf residence [REDACTED], having been twice to\nmeetings with Kokaté, Wapounaba, Bernard Mokom and later David Banga.1749 P-1847\nconfirmed the purpose was the same, namely François Bozizé’s return to power; they were\nasked to take up contact with people at Bossangoa, Bernard Mokom was responsible for\ncontacting the Anti-Balaka in Bossangoa and at the frontier with Cameroon, and others in\nthe CAR.1750\nIn a similar vein, the Chamber considers that Didier Ouebio, who stated to have been living\nat the Golf residence for several months,1751 was clearly trying to avoid providing fully\ntruthful information.

In light of witnesses providing specific\ncontext to the emails in question, mostly importantly by confirming their exchanges with Mr\nNgaïssona at the relevant time, the Chamber finds that differences in time stamps or\ndiscrepant ways in which responses to various emails were sent2036 do not render the emails\nunreliable.2037\nTurning to the emails before the Chamber, in one exchange on 24 and 25 June 2013, P-2843\nasked whether Mr Ngaïssona would still be in Douala or Yaoundé until 8 July, as P-2843\nwanted to discuss the situation of the country, especially certain details that they could not\ntalk about on the telephone (‘la situation du pays surtout sur certaines pistes qu’on ne\npouvait pas en parler au téléphone’).2038\nP-2843 testified that at the time, Mr Ngaïssona was in Douala and P-2843 asked to discuss\nthe situation in the country with him because it was very difficult, and he was afraid to\ndiscuss even the situation [REDACTED] over the telephone.2039 The attachment did not refer\nto matters which could not be discussed over the phone [REDACTED].2040\n2035 See e.g. P-2843: T-073, p. 58, lines 12-17.\n2036 See Ngaïssona Defence Yahoo BT Response, ICC-01/14-01/18-1546-Conf, paras 14-16.\n2037 The Chamber notes in this regard the following: (i) the argument that all versions of all email threads would\nnecessarily have to contain all related emails presupposes that an individual would necessarily always respond to the\nlatest email received; (ii) differing time stamps can be explained by a number of factors, yet what matters in the view\nof the Chamber is that the sequence of emails is clear based on their content; (iii) one example pointed to by the\nNgaïssona Defence with a view to illustrating that its sequence is an ‘impossibility’ since the response to one email\nwould have come before the initial email (see CAR-OTP-2124-0892) can be explained by looking at a different\niteration of the exchange, which places the emails with their time stamp in the relevant chronology (see CAR-OTP-\n2130-3377); and (iv) the reports on the extraction and processing of the emails from the account associated with Mr\nNgaïssona do not seem to suggest any abnormalities in this process, except for not respecting the ‘parent/child\nrelationship’ between messages and attachments (see Reports, CAR-OTP-2118-6255; CAR-OTP-2130-4492).\nAccordingly, the Chamber has relied on the emails and assessed their content within the context of all the evidence\nbefore it, including that of witnesses who testified about exchanging with Mr Ngaïssona.\n2038 Email, CAR-OTP-2130-3372, at 3372.

First, P-\n2841 never seeing [REDACTED] buying the mentioned supplies2107 does not negate the\nsending of the email and, more importantly, the requesting of such items to Mr Ngaïssona.\nSecond, the email does not refer to [REDACTED] as being ‘in charge’ of the south,2108 but\nrather as being a focal or contact point for the southern area, the question of whether\n[REDACTED] controlled any group is therefore immaterial as such control is no\nprecondition for serving as contact person. Third, the email itself and also P-2843’s\nexplanations provided thereon do not suggest that any money would indeed have been\nreceived, that P-2841 thought he would have noticed if such money had been available2109\nis thus equally immaterial.

First, Mr Yekatom mentions the idea of\na movement to fight the Seleka, which was started ‘here’ as opposed to ‘Zaire’, implying\nthat a movement was created in the CAR. This by itself does not lead to conclude that such\nmovement was separate to the Anti-Balaka. Second, and more importantly, in a different\nvideo in which Mr Yekatom appears, he indeed says so himself: introducing himself as ‘chef\nde mouvement Anti-Balaka de zone sud’, he continues to explain that when he found other\nsoldiers in Zongo, he thought it was better to return to the CAR and ‘[c]’est là où que j’ai\ncréé le mouvement A[nti-Balaka] pour venir chasser ces mercenaires qui sont venus détruire\nnotre pays’.2562\n2558 Video, CAR-OTP-2065-0716, at 00:03:19-00:03:48; Transcript, CAR-OTP-2107-6924; Translation, CAR-OTP-\n2122-2292, at 2295, lines 61-71.\n2559 Video, CAR-OTP-2065-0716, at 00:03:49-00:05:15; Transcript, CAR-OTP-2107-6924; Translation, CAR-OTP-\n2122-2292, at 2295-96, lines 69-87.\n2560 Yekatom Defence Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2737-Corr-Red, para. 222.\n2561 See section IV.A.7.iii.a.ii below.\n2562 Video, CAR-OTP-2118-0415, at 00:54:22-00:54:45; Transcript, CAR-OTP-2127-4357; Translation, CAR-OTP-\n2127-4410, at 4432, lines 760-770. The Chamber notes the Yekatom Defence’s opposition to this video in light of it\nbeing outside the temporal scope, and the appearance of Mr Yekatom being made for a political campaign when\nrunning to be elected as member of parliament (see Annex A to the Yekatom Defence Response to the “Prosecution’s\nEight Application for Submission of Audio/Videos Evidence from the Bar Table”, 26 June 2023, ICC-01/14-01/18-\n1945-Conf, 5 July 2023, ICC-01/14-01/18-1963-Conf-Anx-A, pp. 57-58; see also T-169, p. 82, lines 15-22). For\npurposes of its determination at hand, the Chamber considers this to be immaterial as a video having been aired after\nthe time relevant to the charges does not negate the content of what Mr Yekatom is shown as saying on the video.\nNeither does the fact that his appearance may have been related to a political campaign.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 359/1616 24 July 2025",

The Chamber finds equally clearly established by the evidence as discussed\nbelow that Mr Ngaïssona was part of this group, active in its discussions, and that Lin\nBanoukepa, a lawyer in France at the time and, as further discussed below, chosen as\nFROCCA executive director, did not work in isolation. The Chamber considers that the\nevidence as outlined below makes clear that any steps undertaken in the context of FROCCA\nwere part of broader-scale attempts to ensure François Bozizé’s return to power.

Therein, he\nmentions being surrounded by compatriots with whom they discussed and agreed to set up\na structure called ‘Front pour le retour à l’ordre constitutionnel en Centrafrique (Frocca)’,\nwith the goal to closely follow and denounce events in the country with a view to informing\nthe international community.2568 Asked whether return to constitutional order means he\nwould want to re-take power, he answers, ‘Oui. Reprendre le pouvoir. Si l’occasion se\nprésente, je le […] ferai’.2569 Further asked whether this would be by political or military\nmeans, he answers, ‘Oh, la voie politique puisque…la voie des armes ne vient que lorsque\nla solution politique n’est pas trouvée, bon ben…on choisit la voie des armes.

Indeed, the Chamber agrees, as the evidence above and\nbelow also shows, that self-defence groups were formed in various localities across the CAR.\nThe Chamber further agrees that their objectives included rising against the atrocities\ncommitted by the Seleka and removing Michel Djotodia as well as the Seleka from power,\nand that such objectives evolved over time. The Chamber notes in this regard also its\ndiscussion on the efforts to structure the Anti-Balaka as a whole further following the attacks\nof 5 December 2013.3301\nHowever, the Chamber disagrees that the various self-defence groups pursued their\nobjectives in isolation and without coordination. The Chamber also disagrees with the\nsuggestion that the Anti-Balaka would have been divided into separate ‘clusters’.3302 The\nevidence before the Chamber clearly shows that self-defence groups in various localities\ncommunicated, with each other and also with individuals in other localities in the CAR and\nabroad, and coordinated with a view to descending towards Bangui and eventually launching\nthe coordinated attacks against Bangui and Bossangoa on 5 December 2013. Further, in the\nChamber’s view, and as is also clear from a holistic assessment of the evidence before it, the\nfact that groups initially started out separately does not exclude their coordinated action\nthereafter.

Super-imposed on this core objective, which remained static, rested various\npolitical and personal interests that evolved over time.\nIn assessing the objectives and policies of the Anti-Balaka, the Chamber has examined\nfactors that cumulatively played a role in its evolution. This includes events of the end of\n2012 and early 2013 which, in the view of the Chamber, set the stage on which the Anti-\nBalaka objectives and policies could exist and be implemented at least as of September 2013.\nThese factors are discussed below.\nAt the outset, the evidence before the Chamber shows that the various self-defence groups\nstarted out to defend themselves against the abuses committed by the Seleka.3307 For some\n3303 See section IV.A.4 above.\n3304 See section IV.A.6 below.\n3305 See section IV.A.6 below.\n3306 See section IV.A.8.ii below.\n3307 P-1172 Second Statement, CAR-OTP-2082-1058-R03, at 1064, para. 35 (the witness thought the movement was\nestablished so people could defend themselves because the Seleka were doing harm even in the small villages); P-\n1647 Statement, CAR-OTP-2050-0654-R02, at 0658, para. 28; P-1647: T-194, p. 8, lines 16-21, p. 16, lines 10-19\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 452/1616 24 July 2025",

Concretely, the Chamber considers that the abuses and violence committed by the\nSeleka following its coup not only confirmed the fears forewarned by François Bozizé, as\ndiscussed below, but also reinforced communal distrust, grief and feelings of revenge among\nthe common population against the at that stage known ‘enemy’, the Seleka.\nAs the evidence outlined below shows, several witnesses testified as to how, within this\ncontext, the Anti-Balaka started targeting the Muslim civilian population, describing how\nthe latter were seen as accomplices of the Seleka and responsible for the violence and human\nrights abuses reportedly perpetrated by the Seleka. In this overall framework of Seleka\nviolence and resulting perceptions, the Anti-Balaka equated the Muslim civilian population\nwith the Seleka and its acts, targeting it accordingly.3317 This was another factor considered\nby the Chamber that cumulatively played into the evolution of the Anti-Balaka and its\nobjectives and policies.\nCatherine Samba-Panza testified that ‘generally speaking, [the Anti-Balaka] wanted\nretaliation, reprisals against the Seleka and those in favour of the Seleka, and the Muslims\nwho had helped the Seleka to take power and those who had committed all those crimes\nwhich we all deplore’, testifying that ‘the majority of the Anti-Balaka, they were moved in\nthis spirit of revenge’ and ‘above all’ wanted to ensure that the Seleka, who were responsible\nfor crimes, would no longer hold power.3318 She also stated that the Peuhls were targeted by\n3316 See section IV.A.1.iv above.\n3317 See also sections IV.A.6, IV.A.8.ii below.\n3318 P-0952: T-249, p. 55, line 13 – p. 56, line 6.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 455/1616 24 July 2025",

Specifically, P-2232, who was in Zongo [REDACTED] at the\ntime, testified that during this period, ‘people were scared. We were frightened of our\nMuslim brothers who were in our country. And therefore everybody was suspicious of our\nMuslim brothers. So the youth increased their vigilance as regards their Muslim brothers\nbecause it is through them that the Seleka elements were able to enter the town of\nBangui’.3323 He further stated that ‘it is when the Seleka started killing and committing acts\nof violence that hatred set in, because the Seleka used their Muslim identity to attack the\npopulation’.3324 P-2232 explained that ‘the Seleka perpetrated violence against the\npopulation’, so ‘the instinct of the Anti-Balaka is to kill the Muslim’ and ‘[m]any people\njoined the Anti-Balaka movement in order to exact revenge and so whenever they met a\nMuslim, even a child, their reflex action was to kill that Muslim’, ‘during operations [Anti-\nBalaka] always wanted to try and neutralise or kill them’, for which reason there were many\ncivilian deaths.3325\n3319 P-0952: T-250, p. 65, line 24 – p. 66, line 14.\n3320 P-0952: T-250, p. 9, lines 4-20.\n3321 P-0952: T-252, p. 27, line 13 – p. 28, line 2.\n3322 P-0952: T-250, p. 9, lines 4-20.\n3323 P-2232: T-075, p. 12, line 18 – p. 13, line 8.\n3324 P-2232: T-076, p. 17, lines 5-9.\n3325 P-2232: T-075, p. 64, line 10 – p. 65, line 24.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 456/1616 24 July 2025",

For\nexample, P-0967, a Muslim civilian, testified that Bozizé led people to understand that the\nenemy was fast approaching and was not from the CAR, but foreign, and therefore the\ncitizens of the CAR had to be alert and vigilant.3399 According to P-0967, after this speech\nthe people’s understanding of the country changed, in that the population thought that the\nrebellion was managed by the Muslims and were disappointed vis-à-vis the Muslims.3400\nSimilarly, P-0475 understood the speech to refer to being alert to Muslim compounds\nbecause jihadists would enter those compounds.3401 P-0475 understood the reference to\nfenced compounds in the speech to be covertly referring to Muslims because they ‘usually\nlive in houses with compounds’, and this is what immediately comes to the minds of Central\nAfricans.3402 P-0475 agreed that also non-Muslims lived in fenced compounds, but explained\nthat in the beginning it was only Muslims.3403 He stated that ‘[Bozizé] asked the Central\nAfricans to be vigilant so that there would be no attack by the Muslims.

And amongst the Seleka, most of the Seleka elements\nwere Muslims’.3409 P-2232 testified that ‘Bozizé did not talk about Muslims.

Far from\nbeing a mere innocent call for peaceful demonstrations, as suggested by the Ngaïssona\nDefence, the Chamber is of the view that this speech was meant to set the tone of\npreparedness for the possibility of ‘real’ Central Africans fighting, to their death, against\nanyone who was considered to be ‘foreigner’. This speech was made in full knowledge of\nthe Seleka, in their essence, having come to the fore through a coalition of Central African\ngroups opposed to the Bozizé administration,3417 and in this knowledge falsely claimed that\nthe Seleka included exclusively ‘foreigners’, and not a single Central African.3418\nThe Chamber notes that this speech did not directly refer to Muslims within the CAR in\ngeneral, and that this speech, on its own, did not make Muslims out to be the enemy.3419\nHowever, the Chamber recalls how the speech and in particular the reference to ‘fenced\n3413 P-2232: T-079, p. 6, line 7 – p. 8, line 18.\n3414 P-2625: T-188, p. 33, line 2 – p. 34, line 2.\n3415 P-2625: T-188, p. 16, lines 13-15, p. 34, line 5 – p. 35, line 3.\n3416 See Translation, CAR-OTP-2060-0678, at 0685, lines 204-205.\n3417 See section IV.A.1.i above.\n3418 See Translation, CAR-OTP-2060-0678, at 0685, lines 199-202.\n3419 The Chamber notes in this regard also a speech given by François Bozizé given on occasion of the 54-year\nanniversary of the CAR, seemingly in early December 2012, meaning at a time when the Seleka existed and advanced,\nbut had not yet carried out its first main attack (see P-0889: T-108, p. 56, lines 1-21 referring to Speech, CAR-OTP-\n2100-0540, at 0544; see also section IV.A.1.ii above).\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 470/1616 24 July 2025",

This is not negated by François Bozizé also calling, at that stage\nof the conflict, for peaceful protest.\nThe speech of François Bozizé held on 27 December 2012 was not the only address to the\npopulation in the context of the advancing Seleka. The Chamber considered in this context\nas a further cumulative factor that François Bozizé’s message was widely known and drew\nsectarian lines well before the coup and the events in the latter half of 2013 because of its\nrepetition by others and its dissemination prior to the Seleka coup in March 2013, including\nthe support expressed by Mr Ngaïssona as outlined below. The Chamber considered as an\nadditional cumulative factor that certain youth organisations took on François Bozizé’s\nappeal to vigilance by setting up roadblocks and checkpoints ‘to find hidden Seleka and their\naccomplices’, targeting Muslims and CAR ethnicities associated with Muslims.\nIn this context, the Chamber refers to Levy Yakété, two days after François Bozizé’s speech\nat PK0, calling in a radio broadcast3420 on the youth to redouble their vigilance efforts and\nkeep a watchful eye, particularly in Bangui, Bimbo and Begoua, as illegal activities and other\nsuspicious behaviour were occurring, stating that unknown people should be handed over to\nthe police and gendarmerie, reminding not to use any violence in carrying out these actions\nand calling for a multiplication of checkpoints on all arterial roads in Bangui.3421\nThe Chamber further recalls in this regard its discussion of the activities of COCORA and\nCOAC at checkpoints in Bangui prior to the Seleka coup.3422\nThis was followed by François Bozizé’s address to the people on 31 December 2012 on\noccasion of the New Year,3423 which referred to the crisis in the country and stated, inter\nalia, that the CAR was divided, having become two countries with one belonging to the\n3420 Audio, CAR-OTP-2000-0668; Transcript, CAR-OTP-2087-9783; Translation, CAR-OTP-2087-9850.\n3421 Translation, CAR-OTP-2087-9850, at 9852.\n3422 See section IV.A.1.ii.b above.\n3423 Audio, CAR-OTP-2000-0632; Transcript CAR-OTP-2060-0631; Translation CAR-OTP-2060-0693.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 471/1616 24 July 2025",

While telling the ‘youth of the CAR’ to remain calm, the message\ncontinued to state that once they would be told that their lives are in danger ‘tu peux faire\ntout ce que tu veux’ and that ‘[d]ès que le besoin se fait sentir, on te fera appel’.3462 In the\nview of the Chamber, far from being a simple appeasing call, this message implied a state of\nalert, and that the youth could – and would – be called on as needed.\nMore generally, Adrien Poussou considered that ‘the rhetoric of the government was to get\nChristian Central Africans to understand that foreigners were coming and taking their\ncountry away from them [and] if [they] allowed the Seleka rebellion to enter Bangui, it would\nmean that the foreigners, the Chadians and the Sudanese, would come and take control of\nthe country’, a rhetoric which resonated with the population given that ten years earlier,\nBozizé had orchestrated a coup with the support of the Chadian army, that brutalised people\nin the 2013 to 2014 crisis, ‘behaving as an occupying force’.3463\nP-1847 testified that the Bozizé government began marshalling supporters against the Seleka\nrebellion, frequently and widely circulating information on the radio and in papers about the\nSudanese and Chadians encroaching into the CAR territory and committing offences, for\nexample via David Banga, director-general of the Central African radio and Jevon Papa\nZama, who had a daily radio programme in which he denounced the Seleka violence and\nbroadcast messages in support of François Bozizé against the ‘Islamists’, such as asking the\npopulation to be vigilant.3464\nAdrien Poussou also referred to this programme, stating that Radio Centrafrique was ‘the\nvoice of the government at the time’, and mentioning a programme called ‘Ye so a lingbi ti\n3460 P-0808: T-070, p. 42, lines 10-12.

While\nit is clear that calls for peaceful demonstrations and refraining from violence such as\nthrowing stones against individuals or people were made, all of the above also unequivocally\ncalled for ‘vigilance’ of the addressees, thereby maintaining the Central African population\nin a state of alert against ‘foreigners’. The references to ‘foreigners’ have to be seen in the\ncontext of the Seleka not being in fact a ‘foreign invasion’, even though it used combatants\nfrom Chad and Sudan, as well as in light of the fact that they were made in direct connection\nto ‘foreigners’ living in the CAR and supporting the Seleka, in contrast with ‘real’ or\n‘authentic’ Central Africans.\nThe Chamber furthermore notes as another cumulative factor its discussion of the creation\nand activities of FROCCA, which marshalled support against the Seleka regime with express\npleas to return to ‘the constitutional order’, signifying François Bozizé’s return to power.3467\nAdrien Poussou testified that within FROCCA, the prevailing rhetoric was that Christian\nCentral Africans ‘were being robbed of [their] own country by Muslim invaders. And it just\nso happens that the Seleka regime was made up of [their] fellow citizens of the Muslim\nfaith’, and that this was sort of language was also being used by Mr Ngaïssona.3468 According\nto this witness, FROCCA used ‘hate speech or hateful language’ in its communications with\nthe goal of spreading incendiary information, such as the alleged planned ‘Islamisation’ of\n3465 P-2625: T-188-ENG, p. 35, line 12 – p. 36, line 4, p. 37, lines 7-10; T-188-FRA, p. 37, lines 19-22; T-192, p. 10,\nlines 22-25.\n3466 Ngaïssona Defence Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2736-AnxA-Corr-Red, paras 152-155.\n3467 See section IV.A.3 above.\n3468 P-2625: T-189, p. 67, line 20 – p. 68, line 5.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 479/1616 24 July 2025",

The Chamber thus considered as a last\ncumulative factor that each stage of the evolution of the Anti-Balaka objectives and policies\nwas public knowledge, and that it was instrumentalised by François Bozizé, Mr Ngaïssona\nand others to further their political or personal agenda.\nAs outlined below, the Chamber is of the view that Mr Ngaïssona was aware of the context\nand how it developed already through the meetings he participated in while in Cameroon,\nand at the latest in discussions concerning FROCCA. Further, Mr Ngaïssona was informed\nof the attacks taking place as from September 2013. Similarly, Mr Yekatom, given his own\nhistory with the Seleka and flight to Zongo, knew about the context and how members of his\ngroup, irrespective whether they were trained FACA members or not, did not distinguish\nbetween Muslim civilians and the Seleka. Yet, Mr Yekatom as leader of his group did not\ndemand or emphasise the need for such distinction when instructing his elements in\npreparation of the attack on Bangui on 5 December 2013, in Yamwara, or when his group\nadvanced along the PK9-Mbaïki axis.\nImportantly, in a very public visit to Mbaïki on 12 February 2014, following the dislocation\nof Muslims therefrom,3488 Catherine Samba-Panza, then-transition president of the CAR,\ndenounced the violence and killings committed by the Anti-Balaka, warning the group it\nwould pay should it continue.3489 This had been prefaced by a statement of the commander\nof the Sangaris, Francisco Soriano, who declared that the Anti-Balaka were ‘enemies of\npeace’.3490 This was followed by the Anti-Balaka coordination, under lead of Mr Ngaïssona,\ncomplaining about the characterisation of the group in what it called ‘incendiary\n3488 See section IV.E.6 below.\n3489 P-0952: T-249, p. 40, line 4 – p. 43, line 3; T-252, p. 58, line 20 – p. 59, line 8; Video, CAR-OTP-2023-1636, at\n00:19:06-00:27:16; Translation, CAR-OTP-00002254, at 0007-9.

Indeed, in a document dated 11 February 2014\nissued under Mr Ngaïssona’s name, the background to the conflict is recalled by stating that\n‘la population, victime des exactions des S[eleka] à travers la Centrafrique depuis le 10\ndécembre 2012, a regagné les rangs des Antibalaka avec un esprit de vengence [sic] envers\nles ex-Séléka est [sic] les sujets musulmans qui ont soutenu les Séléka durant leur occupation\nde la RCA’.3494 Similarly, a press statement of the same day appears to criticise that\n‘Muslims’, in general, were speaking up against the Anti-Balaka, who are described as\n‘dignes fils du pays’ which engaged in an ‘œuvre salvatrice’.3495 In an interview later in\nFebruary 2014, Mr Ngaïssona stated: ‘We cannot accept the attacks by the Muslims’.3496\nEven later in 2014, Mr Ngaïssona continued using rhetoric similar to that used by François\nBozizé in mid-March 2013, when stating: ‘Un étranger qui vient dans notre pays, pour faire\nde l’occupation, prendre des armes et tuer les enfants du pays, nous ne pouvons pas accepter\n3491 Press statement, CAR-OTP-2025-0380, at 0381, 0383.

Indeed, as outlined\nbelow, Mr Yekatom must have been aware of the statements against Muslims, in general,\nmade by elements and leaders of his group under his command, and, when giving\ninstructions to his group, himself did not draw an appropriate distinction between targeting\nSeleka members or individuals belonging to the Muslim civilian population.3503 In fact, the\nevidence before the Chamber indicates that Mr Yekatom himself expressly instructed the\nelements under his command to attack Muslim civilians, in the context of events relating to\ncrimes as charged in this case.3504 Mr Yekatom not only issued such instructions to elements\n3497 Translation, CAR-OTP-2088-0649, at 0652-53, lines 85-94.

As is\napparent from the objectives of the groups that were advancing through the provinces\ntowards Bangui, hostilities within the wider CAR regions were not the ultimate aim: indeed,\nas discussed in further detail below, the hostilities in the CAR provinces eventually\nculminated in the coordinated attacks on Bangui and Bossangoa on 5 December 2013.3507\nThe Chamber notes that around the same time as the advance of the Anti-Balaka groups\ntowards Bangui started in the earnest, the Seleka coalition was dissolved by Michel\nDjotodia.3508\nFor example, Jo-Brice Ouabiro Dana explained that before they set out to attack villages,\nthey were given instructions of which villages and when to attack, and they had an overall\ntime plan to keep to;3509 they could not attack in just any way, but attacked villages or\nlocalities with checkpoints or Seleka bases, never villages with only civilians, since the\nattacks were targeted to ‘get rid’ of the Seleka and ‘chase them’ (‘déloger’) from their\nposts.3510\nAs regards who was giving instructions to the groups, Jo-Brice Ouabiro Dana said that they\ncame from those who were commanding, for example Dedane, Ndangba, Romain; and if\nthere were calls and they asked to fight the Seleka bases, they would go.3511\n3507 See sections IV.B.1, IV.C.1 below.\n3508 See Annex 6 to CAR Panel Interim Report 2014, CAR-OTP-2001-0835, at 0894, para. 1.

Similarly in this context, in his view Muslims needed to be ‘help[ed] to get out of\nthere’. In addition, while stating that they could not destroy ‘everything’ because they\nwanted the population to return, he also stated that to avoid being shot by a Seleka, all\n‘Seleka’ houses were destroyed, with such houses for search for weapons being identified\non the basis of the assumption that ‘Seleka’ usually lived in a group fenced off from the rest.\nThe Chamber is of the view that the activities of Jo-Brice Ouabiro Dana’s group, even as\ndescribed by the witness himself, were clearly not informed by a genuine distinction between\nactual adversaries, i.e. members of the Seleka or individuals engaged in hostilities in case\nthere were any, but rather focused on what, in the group’s perception, a ‘Seleka’ would be.\n3535 P-0966 Statement, CAR-OTP-2031-0241-R03, at 0249, para. 46.\n3536 P-0966 Statement, CAR-OTP-2031-0241-R03, at 0249, para. 47.\n3537 P-0966 Statement, CAR-OTP-2031-0241-R03, at 0249, para. 47.\n3538 P-0966 Statement, CAR-OTP-2031-0241-R03, at 0249, para. 47.\n3539 P-0966 Statement, CAR-OTP-2031-0241-R03, at 0249, para. 47.\n3540 P-0966 Statement, CAR-OTP-2031-0241-R03, at 0249, para. 48.\n3541 See section IV.A.5 above.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 491/1616 24 July 2025",

P-\n2453, a civilian, was in one of these vehicles with others travelling on Thursday, 5 September\n2013, to a weekly Saturday market. From what P-2658 described, he appeared to have\nhimself been in the Anti-Balaka group that attacked the vehicles. P-2049, on the other hand,\nprovided evidence about what he heard from the victims who had been traveling in the\nsecond vehicle.\nP-2453 stated that the vehicle he was in was fired at when crossing a large group of people\nwith weapons and a man with a traditional rifle and gris-gris tried to stop the vehicle\n[REDACTED].3593 [REDACTED] P-2453 saw the group, which he later learned were the\nAnti-Balaka, some in civilian clothes and others in a mixture of military and civilian clothes,\ntaking all goods from the vehicle, after which they went back in the direction of Bowaye.3594\nP-2453 and a female passenger on the vehicle, [REDACTED] who was wearing a Muslim\nattire, were eventually found by a group of seven Anti-Balaka, armed with traditional rifles\nand machetes, also called ‘balaka’, and asked if P-2453 was a Muslim; these Anti-Balaka\nMetadata, CAR-OTP-2085-0822; CAR-OTP-2085-2461; Photograph, CAR-OTP-2085-0831; Metadata, CAR-OTP-\n2085-0832; CAR-OTP-2085-2464; Photograph, CAR-OTP-2085-0841; Metadata, CAR-OTP-2085-0842; CAR-\nOTP-2085-2467; Photograph, CAR-OTP-2085-0851; Metadata, CAR-OTP-2085-0852; CAR-OTP-2085-2470;\nPhotograph, CAR-OTP-2085-0861; Metadata, CAR-OTP-2085-0862; CAR-OTP-2085-2475; Photograph, CAR-\nOTP-2085-0871; Metadata, CAR-OTP-2085-0872; CAR-OTP-2085-2478; Photograph, CAR-OTP-2085-0881;\nMetadata, CAR-OTP-2085-0882; CAR-OTP-2085-2483; Photograph, CAR-OTP-2085-0891; Metadata, CAR-OTP-\n2085-0892; CAR-OTP-2085-2486; Photograph, CAR-OTP-2085-0901; Metadata, CAR-OTP-2085-0902; CAR-\nOTP-2085-2491; Photograph, CAR-OTP-2085-0911; Metadata, CAR-OTP-2085-0912; CAR-OTP-2085-2496;\nPhotograph, CAR-OTP-2085-0921; Metadata, CAR-OTP-2085-0922; CAR-OTP-2085-2499; Photograph, CAR-\nOTP-2085-0931; Metadata, CAR-OTP-2085-0932; CAR-OTP-2085-2502; Photograph, CAR-OTP-2085-0941;\nMetadata, CAR-OTP-2085-0942; CAR-OTP-2085-2507).\n3593 P-2453 Statement, CAR-OTP-2111-0415-R04, at 0420, paras 27-28, at 0421, para. 32; P-2453: T-137, p. 37, line\n12 – p. 39, line 8.

The first provides information of an individual that also does not seem to have\nbeen in Zere at the time of the attack, without providing a source for the information, while the second is a compilation\nof anonymous ‘statements’, with the specific ‘statement’ in question not providing any source for the information and\nin fact being unclear on whether it even relates to the same event. P-2049, due to [REDACTED], as well as talking to\nindividuals at the École de la Liberté, had more immediate, even if still indirect, information on the victims of the\nattack. Similarly, the Chamber does not consider the information impacted by the suggestion that a video, which is\nnot available to the Chamber and that according to P-2049 shows the burning of Djouli Djibrila, would have been\ntaken in March 2011 (see T-102, p. 40, lines 6-17; Ngaïssona Defence Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2736-AnxA-\nCorr-Red, para. 318, n. 1113 referring to Metadata, CAR-D30-0008-0087). Indeed, P-2049 made clear that he did not\nrecord the video but received it from someone else, that he knows Djouli, visible on that video and burned on the street\nduring the events in Zere, and that at the time of his testimony, he was in [REDACTED] (see P-2049: T-102, p. 38,\nline 8 – p. 42, line 7). The Chamber similarly cannot conclude whether the event described in Report, CAR-OTP-\n2110-0915, at 0920, para. 31 is the same as that depicted on video, as the identity of the victim supposedly shown on\nthe video described is redacted and identified by persons as imam or village head. In relation to the latter report, the\nChamber further notes that the Defence argued lack of relevance and probative value in a different context (see Annex\n1 to Defence Response to the Prosecution’s “Request for the Submission of Evidence from the Bar Table regarding\nthe Prevalence of Sexual and Gender Based Violence”, ICC-01/14-01/18-1278-Conf-Anx1, pp. 74-75; Annex A to\nYekatom Defence Response to the Prosecution’s “Request for the Submission of Evidence from the Bar Table\nregarding the Prevalence of Sexual and Gender Based Violence”, 4 January 2022, ICC-01/14-01/18-1233, ICC-01/14-\n01/18-1279-Conf-AnxA, pp. 20-21).

Attacks between mid-September and December 2013\nThe evidence shows that, following the attacks in the Bossangoa region in the north, as\ndiscussed above, the movement of the Anti-Balaka expanded by October 2013 to other\nregions of the CAR. This included to Bouar in the west, in Nana-Mambéré prefecture and\ntowards Bangui in the south, through Ndjo, Bossembélé, and Boali in Ombella-M’Poko\nprefecture. This is exemplified by the attacks that took place in these locations respectively.\nP-2926 concluded in his report that the first clashes between Seleka and Anti-Balaka took\nplace in August and September 2013, followed by Anti-Balaka attacks against Seleka in\ntowns in the west, including Bouca, Bouar, Bozoum, Bossembélé,3792 expanded by October\n2013 into the north-west up to Bouar and south towards Bossembélé and Mbourouba, north\nof Damara.3793 According to P-2926, while initially directed against the Seleka, the self-\ndefence groups quickly mixed Seleka and rural and urban Muslim communities.3794\nThis is also reflected in P-1847’s evidence regarding instructions being received by Dedane,\nwho was coordinating these groups in close communication with them. P-1847,\n[REDACTED] said that the former PG in Bossangoa and Bouar were under Dedane’s\ncommand and [REDACTED] they had received orders from François Bozizé to descend on\nBangui and attack, and that is how they started to attack the towns from Bossangoa, then to\n3791 P-2416 Statement, CAR-OTP-2106-0489-R02, at 0500-01, paras 32-33.\n3792 P-2926 Report, CAR-OTP-2127-4289, at 4304, para. 34, at 4310, para. 52.\n3793 P-2926 Report, CAR-OTP-2127-4289, at 4310, para. 52.\n3794 P-2926 Report, CAR-OTP-2127-4289, at 4310, para. 52.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 526/1616 24 July 2025",

Indeed, D30-4914’s generalised claim that it is ‘absolutely wrong’ that\nMr Ngaïssona or Bernard Mokom would have coordinated the attack on the basis of them\nbeing civilians is inconsequential. Involvement in preparations of an attack in a coordinating\nrole is not excluded by mere virtue of the fact of someone not having a military role or\nbackground.

Meetings at Yamwara school at the end of December 2013\nIn this context, the Yekatom Defence argues that, contrary to the Prosecution’s assertions,\nthe evidence does not show that the various Anti-Balaka groups were ‘unified, structured,\nand ideologically homogenous’.3967 In support of this argument, the Yekatom Defence\nsubmits that P-0876 engaged in various coordination attempts directly before and in the\naftermath of the Bangui Attack, through meetings with [REDACTED]’s group and meetings\nwith the ‘RFACPP’ and then also others at the base of Mr Yekatom’s group in a school in\nYamwara (hereinafter: ‘Yamwara’).3968\nIn light of these arguments, the Chamber has considered the evidence regarding meetings\nthat took place at Yamwara at the end of December 2013, as provided by individuals who\nattended these meetings.\nThe Chamber finds that the meetings attest to the emerging individual political ambitions of\nthe various Anti-Balaka group leaders following the Bangui Attack. They also show that, at\nthis time, not every Anti-Balaka leader may have had a sustained interest in supporting the\nreturn of François Bozizé to power. At the same time, the Chamber considers that the\nmeetings do not attest to a divided movement or separately existing movements. Rather, the\nmeetings show attempts at pivoting the Anti-Balaka’s combined force towards securing\npolitical leverage and, in some cases, ministerial positions in a potential future government.\n3967 Yekatom Defence Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2737-Corr-Red, para. 167; see also paras 168-175.\n3968 Yekatom Defence Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2737-Conf-Corr, paras 176-184.

Importantly, the Chamber is of the view that\nthe various Anti-Balaka groups did not have to be a monolithic or singular entity and/or\nideologically homogeneous at any stage of the events. Indeed, as outlined above, despite\napparent political or personal viewpoints and ambitions, the Anti-Balaka groups coordinated\ntheir actions around their core objective of removing Michel Djotodia and the Seleka from\npower. That this was the common core is also amplified by the discussions at the meetings\nat Yamwara as outlined, which centred around what would happen once this core objective\nwould have been achieved – and indeed did not question it as common baseline. The\nChamber therefore considers that the suggestion that Mr Yekatom’s purported objective was\n‘not to fight for Bozizé’s return’4033 does not mean that Mr Yekatom’s group was not Anti-\nBalaka, or that it did not share the core objective of wanting to remove Michel Djotodia and\nthe Seleka from power, including the way in which this objective was pursued and achieved\non the ground.\nb.

It is clear\nfrom the evidence as further outlined below that in particular Mr Ngaïssona, at the time of\nthe initial meetings freshly installed general coordinator of the Anti-Balaka, exhibited\nambitions which developed to no longer centring around bringing François Bozizé back to\npower, but rather around personal interests combined with wanting to represent the Anti-\nBalaka which were still a party to the conflict to be taken into account, and thus, in the\ngeneral political dynamics, an influential factor to be reckoned with.\nIt is within this context that the Chamber recalls its conclusion that the various Anti-Balaka\ngroups did not have to be a monolithic or singular entity and/or ideologically homogenous\nat any stage of the events.4158 The Chamber is of the view that different Anti-Balaka groups,\nof ‘north’, ‘south’ or other designation, coming together to be represented towards the new\ntransitional authorities and international forces does not signify that there were many\ndifferent groups. Rather, as is clear from the evidence before the Chamber as outlined above\nand below, groups which did have varying super-imposed interests were not only perceived\nto be one movement, the ‘Anti-Balaka’, from the outside, but also presented themselves as\nsuch with a view to being taken into account as party to the conflict.\nConcretely, Catherine Samba-Panza explained that she called on the Anti-Balaka and the\nSeleka to lay down their arms and join forces with her to build the country and install national\ncohesion.4159 She received a delegation of about 15 people of the Anti-Balaka at her\nlimited reliance on this report with regard to a matter which is not disputed, namely the specific date on which\nCatherine Samba-Panza was sworn in as new transition president, the Chamber does not consider it necessary to\naddress these arguments further.\n4158 See paragraph 1526 above.\n4159 P-0952: T-249, p. 19, line 25 – p. 20, line 7.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 578/1616 24 July 2025",

Specifically, P-1193, who was with the group in 2014, stated that ‘Rombhot’\ndisciplined his men when he was not under the influence of alcohol, and that he never saw\nanyone opposing ‘Rombhot’.4289 Similarly, Gérard Ouambou, who could observe the group\nclosely at the beginning of 2014, stated that ‘Rombhot’s’ elements listened to him and those\nwho did not, those that were disciplined by him, left the group.4290 Vivien Beina testified\nthat Mr Yekatom’s group was very well structured, there was military discipline, and Mr\nYekatom respected the military rules and their ranking.4291 The witness testified that Mr\nYekatom’s group included many that were not soldiers, and they were all subject to the same\ndiscipline because they were part of the group.4292 P-1858 testified that he had seen\n‘Rombhot’ giving orders and threats, it seemed to him that his elements, even FACA, were\nafraid of him and his orders were obeyed without question, and if one did not obey,\nMr Yekatom ‘would hit you or you would be killed’.4293 Jacob Mokpem-Bionli stated that\nMr Yekatom was a FACA member who was part of the Anti-Balaka, had his base on the\nroute of Mbaïki, and had a significant number of elements under his control which he led\nwith an iron hand (‘une main de fer’) and disciplined as necessary, including sanctioning\nwhen needed.4294 Roger Okoa-Penguia stated that he was present one day when Mr Yekatom\naddressed his elements and told them to behave appropriately, adding that Mr Yekatom\nmaintained discipline within his elements.4295\nIn this context, the Chamber has considered specific examples which illustrate\nMr Yekatom’s control over his group and the area he was in.

Nous, avec la force on doit rentrer’).4330 The Chamber refers in this regard also to\nits discussion of another video in which Mr Yekatom talks of the creation of his group.4331\nThe Chamber considers of particular note in this regard that P-0876, who tried to emphasise\nthe distinction between ‘Léopold Bara’s stream’ of the Anti-Balaka, as opposed to those who\nfavoured the return of François Bozizé, throughout his testimony, also testified that he was\nnot aware of a separate movement which would have been called ‘RFACPP’ under\nMr Yekatom, as to him, [REDACTED] they were ‘Anti-Balaka who had retreated to a\nlocation behind the airport’.4332\n4325 P-1839: T-172, p. 84, line 11 – p. 85, line 24.\n4326 P-1839: T-172, p. 85, lines 8-17.\n4327 P-0888: T-121, p. 73, line 1 – p. 77, line 13, p. 79, line 3 – p. 80, line 9; T-123, p. 4, line 22 – p. 7, line 16; P-0876\nInterview Transcript, CAR-OTP-2046-0267-R01, at 0277, lines 359-365.\n4328 Video, CAR-OTP-2065-3180, at 00:01:29-00:01:35; Transcript, CAR-OTP-2122-7503, at 7504, lines 30-32;\nVideo, CAR-OTP-2065-0396, at 00:01:45-00:02:02; Transcript, CAR-OTP-2107-6918; Translation, CAR-OTP-\n2122-2284, at 2287, lines 36-43.

Mr Ngaïssona’s role in the Anti-Balaka\nThe evidence before the Chamber shows that following his return to Bangui and taking up\nthe position of general coordinator in a more formalised structure of the Anti-Balaka, Mr\nNgaïssona remained involved with the group’s activities.\nAt the outset, the Chamber notes that the evidence before it, as further outlined below, shows\nthat the knowledge of Mr Ngaïssona and his activities in the context of the Anti-Balaka\nbefore he became general coordinator of the movement in January 2014 depended on the\nperspective and role of each individual testifying thereto. In particular, it is clear from the\nevidence discussed below that elements on the ground advancing through the provinces in\nlate 2013 may not necessarily have been privy to Mr Ngaïssona’s activities at the time, while\npersons more directly concerned with his actions were.\nIn the view of the Chamber, the fact that some individuals did not know of Mr Ngaïssona’s\ninvolvement with the Anti-Balaka before he became general coordinator in January 2014\ndoes not mean that such involvement did not exist.\nThe Chamber recalls that Mr Ngaïssona became general coordinator of the Anti-Balaka\nimmediately upon his return to Bangui on 14 January 2014.4341 In the Chamber’s view, this\nis, by itself, an indication that Mr Ngaïssona was familiar with and involved in at least parts\nof the movement before his officially becoming coordinator.\nFurthermore, Alfred Legrand Ngaya stated that when Mr Ngaïssona returned to Bangui, the\nwitness saw that he knew the Anti-Balaka very well, and realised that Mr Ngaïssona had\nlinks with the military because he saw him with FACA members.4342 For example, on the\nline 19 – p. 63, line 3, p. 67, line 9 – p. 68, line 18; T-095, p. 44, line 22 – p. 45, line 25.

Indeed, the evidence as\nfurther outlined below shows that the underlying reasons for wanting to have a general\ncoordinator for the Anti-Balaka related to a desire for being represented towards the national\nand international authorities, while Mr Ngaïssona as an individual was considered the best\nperson for this role because he was very popular among the CAR youth due to his\ninvolvement in football activities, and at the same time was known for having comparatively\nvast financial resources, which could assist in covering the costs for the Anti-Balaka.\nSpecifically, Alfred Legrand Ngaya testified that there was a sort of vacuum when it came\nto the messages to be conveyed to the political authorities, and because of the necessity to\nhave a spokesperson, a focal point for the Anti-Balaka, in addition to the Anti-Balaka not\nhaving the resources to take care of themselves and Mr Ngaïssona being known for being\ngenerous with money and having easy access to higher political officials, the ComZones\ndesignated Mr Ngaïssona as leader of the Anti-Balaka.4353\nBrice Emotion Namsio stated that after Djotodia’s resignation and before Mr Ngaïssona’s\nreturn to Bangui, Mr Ngaïssona called him to ask if he could come to Bangui to lead ‘them’,\nto which the witness responded that he was only the deputy spokesperson, as Sébastien\nWenezoui was the spokesperson and Konaté spokesperson of the FACA in the group, and\nthe witness did not have the authority to approve Mr Ngaïssona’s return, but if he wanted to\n4351 P-0975 Statement, CAR-OTP-2033-7885-R02, at 7892, para. 52; P-1172 Second Statement, CAR-OTP-2082-\n1058-R03, at 1065, para. 40; P-0966 Statement, CAR-OTP-2031-0241-R03, at 0256, para. 88; P-2232: T-075, p. 50,\nline 23 – p. 51, lines 2, 10, 19-24, p. 54, lines 9-12.

The Chamber has considered the evidence as outlined below, which\nshows that Mr Ngaïssona in fact did exercise control over the Anti-Balaka as an additional\nfactor to assess his contributions to the Anti-Balaka’s activities.\nFirst, various witnesses testified about Mr Ngaïssona being the person to contact when it\ncame to representing the interests of the Anti-Balaka.\nSpecifically, and most importantly, Catherine Samba-Panza, the transition president at the\ntime, testified that from the Anti-Balaka side, and from January 2014 onwards when she took\nher position, she had ‘no other person’ to contact but Mr Ngaïssona, with whom she had her\ncontacts.4370 Aurélien Llorca stated that in the view of the CAR Panel, Mr Ngaïssona was\nindeed coordinating the Anti-Balaka groups from ‘a political point of view’, and Maxime\nMokom was ‘in charge of military operations’.4371 Kasper Agger testified that while different\npersonalities tried to portray themselves as leaders of certain groups of the Anti-Balaka;4372\nat the time of his interview with Mr Ngaïssona in February 2014, he referred to himself as\n‘the coordinator of the Anti-Balaka in a general term’, portrayed himself in that role, and\nwas looked at as ‘an interlocutor’; and the witness found Mr Ngaïssona’s place in Bangui by\nasking for ‘Mr Ngaïssona, the coordinator of Balaka’.4373\nSecond, the Chamber has considered a number of factors indicating that Mr Ngaïssona was\nin a position to take decisions on behalf of the Anti-Balaka and to direct Anti-Balaka groups\nto engage in certain actions.\n4370 P-0952: T-249, p. 38, lines 10-16, p. 34, line 25 – p. 35, line 5; T-251, p. 32, line 5 – p. 33, line 1, p. 33, line 23 –\np. 34, line 21; T-251-ENG, p. 35, lines 8-19; T-251-FRA, p. 36, lines 11-26; T-251, p. 95, lines 10-22.

In any event, the\nChamber refers to its discussion of the general functioning of the Anti-Balaka within the\nframework of its structure evolving over time.4420\nFinancing\nOne of the factors which the Chamber considered for purposes of assessing Mr Ngaïssona’s\ncontributions to the Anti-Balaka in 2014 relates to the question of providing financial\nassistance.\nThe Ngaïssona Defence argues that there is no credible evidence showing that Mr Ngaïssona\nfinanced the Anti-Balaka after the attack of 5 December 2013 for the purchase of weapons\nand ammunition.4421\nHowever, the evidence before the Chamber as further outlined below shows that Mr\nNgaïssona continued to provide financial assistance to the Anti-Balaka also following his\nreturn to Bangui in January 2014. In this regard, the Chamber considers that the specific\npurpose of providing money for purchase of weapons or ammunition is not alone\ndeterminative for concluding on Mr Ngaïssona’s actions in relation to the charges.

At the same time, the\nperson who eventually prevailed in leading the Anti-Balaka was Mr Ngaïssona, and the Anti-\nBalaka were represented as one movement at peace negotiations and in contacts with the\nnational authorities and international community.

Therefore, any discussion of a\npossible split within the Anti-Balaka as an organisation is, at best, of indirect relevance to\nthe determinations of the Chamber.\nIn this regard, the Chamber notes the conclusions of the CAR Panel,4499 which stated in its\n2014 interim report that the ‘idiosyncratic complexity of the structure of anti-Balaka is\nreinforced by the fluidity which characterizes the relationship between its different\ncomponents’.4500 According to the report, Mr Ngaïssona and Sébastien Wenezoui claimed\nto represent ‘Rombhot’ or control the Anti-Balaka groups in Boda and Bouar, while Bara,\nappointed as Anti-Balaka representative in the government but not recognised as such, was\nperceived as being behind the initiative of Montaigne that led to Sébastien Wenezoui being\nchosen as general coordinator, which in turn was qualified by Mr Ngaïssona as ‘farce’.4501\nAt the time of its report in October 2014, the panel found that the division between factions\nhad deepened following the Brazzaville forum.4502\nThe evidence before the Chamber as further outlined below shows that Sébastien Wenezoui\nchallenged Mr Ngaïssona for his leadership of the Anti-Balaka. Whilst Sébastien Wenezoui\nproclaimed himself coordinator of the Anti-Balaka at a meeting in Pissmiss in May 2014,\nfollowing mediation by the NGOs Mouda and PARETO, Mr Ngaïssona prevailed as general\ncoordinator in June 2014, Sébastien Wenezoui being installed as his deputy.

The Chamber is of the view that even if there was\nno formalised coordinated entity with a pre-existing hierarchical structure, and even if\nvarious political and personal interests superimposed the activities over time, and especially\nin the aftermath of Michel Djotodia’s resignation, this did not mean that the Anti-Balaka\ngroups did not engage in coordinated activities. It is clear from the evidence before the\nChamber that the Anti-Balaka was no static structure that already existed before the time\nrelevant to the charges or remained unchanged throughout that period. However, it is also\nclear from the evidence that during the period relevant to the charges, the Anti-Balaka groups\nexhibited clear signs of structure, operational capability and coordination that remained\npresent even if evolving in its details over time.\nEventually, and following a further disagreement surrounding the attendance at the\nBrazzaville forum,4527 Mr Ngaïssona expelled Sébastien Wenezoui from the Anti-Balaka in\nAugust 2014, after which Sébastien Wenezoui set up his own movement.4528\nThe evidence before the Chamber further shows that Joachim Kokaté, who was one of the\nAnti-Balaka representatives in the transition government under Catherine Samba-Panza,\ndistanced himself from the Anti-Balaka around mid-February 2014,4529 while Léopold Bara,\n4524 P-1193: T-124, p. 56, line 24 – p. 57, line 10, p. 64, line 5 – p. 65, line 14; T-125, p. 7, line 24 – p. 8, line 8; P-\n0954: T-166, p. 65, line 18 – p. 66, line 16, p. 71, lines 5-8; P-1858: T-187, p. 14, lines 11-22, p. 16, lines 2-6; P-0888:\nT-120, p. 82, lines 1-23; T-123, p. 15, line 4 – p. 18, line 4, p. 29, lines 11-16, p. 32, lines 4-12, p. 46, line 22 – p. 47,\nline 6; P-0876: T-088, p. 54, line 11 – p. 55, line 9.\n4525 P-1193 Statement, CAR-OTP-2045-0048-R03, at 0054-55, paras 39-40; P-1193: T-125, p. 42, line 20 – p. 43,\nline 8.\n4526 See section IV.A.6.i and paragraphs 1575-1618 above and sections IV.B.1, IV.D.1 below.\n4527 See also P-0884: T-057, p. 15, line 25 – p. 16, line 14.\n4528 Press statement, CAR-OTP-2101-4166, at 4168-69.

In particular, it was used by Anti-Balaka leaders such as\nMr Ngaïssona to suggest that violence and abuses attributed to the Anti-Balaka would\ninstead have been committed by individuals not linked to the Anti-Balaka, who used its name\nfor purposes of committing such violence.\nAurélien Llorca stated that when he interviewed Mr Ngaïssona in March 2014 and asked\nhim about violence and exactions committed by Anti-Balaka elements, Mr Ngaïssona\nresponded that this was done by uncontrolled elements or ‘fake’ Anti-Balaka, explaining that\nhe had asked the international forces in a press release to arrest the ‘fake’ Anti-Balaka, but\nnot having himself taken ‘any specific measures’ since he was not able to stop said acts.4677\nThe witness testified that in the CAR panel’s analysis, an Anti-Balaka element became\n‘uncontrolled’ when acting ‘out of bounds’, such that an element could have been\n‘controlled’ in the evening before, but became ‘uncontrolled’ the day on which they\ncommitted some exaction or a particular act.4678 Aurélien Llorca testified that one needed to\ndistinguish between political coordination and military structure of the organisation, in that,\nsome acts might have been ‘uncontrolled’ because one could not ascribed some political\nresponsibility for them, but they still fell under a military strategy consistent with their\nexecution.4679\nAurélien Llorca stated that Lebene told him during his interview in March 2014 that those\nin the government, such as Kokaté and Bara, did not represent the Anti-Balaka but were self-\ninterested and that people in the government were encouraging the commission of crimes to\ndiscredit the Anti-Balaka, for example ‘Larmassou’ was ‘manipulated by the\ngovernment’.4680 The witness stated that Lebene also told him that all ‘real’ Anti-Balaka bore\nbadges, which allowed them to distinguish the ‘real’ from the ‘fake’ Anti-Balaka.4681\nAurélien Llorca stated that Lebene also said that Andjilo was a company commander in\n4677 P-0287 Statement, CAR-OTP-2115-0239-R01, at 0251-52, para. 57; P-0287: T-020, p. 18, line 22 – p. 20, line 10,\np. 23, line 21 – p. 24, line 1.\n4678 P-0287: T-020, p. 23, lines 2-8; T-021, p. 87, lines 5-22.\n4679 P-0287: T-021, p. 88, lines 6-25.\n4680 P-0287 Statement, CAR-OTP-2115-0239-R01, at 0257, para. 81.\n4681 P-0287 Statement, CAR-OTP-2115-0239-R01, at 0258, para. 85.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 655/1616 24 July 2025",

At the same time, the\nChamber recalls its discussion of the evidence of [REDACTED].4705\nOverall, the Chamber considers that the existence of ‘fake’ Anti-Balaka as a generalised\nconcept is immaterial to its determinations for purposes of the charges insofar as the\nChamber discusses the specific individuals involved and their place or role within the Anti-\nBalaka in relation to each charged incident, as well as in relation to the hostilities during the\nadvance in 2013, and in early 2014. Furthermore, the Chamber is of the view that the\ngeneralised concept is immaterial on a broader level insofar as the existence of individuals\nallegedly operating under the name of the Anti-Balaka does not, in and of itself, negate the\nexistence of (i) a structure or organisation within and among those that considered\nthemselves to be ‘real’ Anti-Balaka; (ii) the shared core objectives of those that considered\nthemselves to be ‘real’ Anti-Balaka; and (iii) the hostilities engaged in by Anti-Balaka\nelements to such extent as to amount to an armed conflict with the Seleka. The Chamber\nfurther notes that these hostilities are not claimed to have been engaged in by ‘fake’ Anti-\nBalaka, indeed, in particular as regards the hostilities during the advance in 2013, the\ngeneralised concept of the ‘fake’ Anti-Balaka was brought up only much later in 2014.\nAnti-Balaka badges\nThe evidence before the Chamber as further outlined below shows that at some point in 2014\nand thereafter,4706 the Anti-Balaka national coordination, under Mr Ngaïssona’s lead,\ndecided to issue badges to Anti-Balaka elements.\nThe Chamber has before it a number of different items which appear to be Anti-Balaka\nbadges or ID cards. One format, visible on a card issued in the name of Mr Yekatom and\nbearing his picture, bears an Anti-Balaka logo, name, function, nationality and address of\nthe bearer, an ID card number, stamp and signature.4707 This same format is visible in other\n4705 See [REDACTED].

The first\ndocument traces the origins of the Anti-Balaka to self-defence groups that set up due to the\nSeleka violence, progressing to and reaching Bangui with the attack on 5 December 2013,\nand eventually leading to the dismissal of Michel Djotodia and Nicolas Tiangaye.4825\nImportantly, the document continues:\nAussi, la population, victime des exactions des S[eleka] à travers la Centrafrique\ndepuis le 10 décembre 2012, a regagné les rangs des Antibalaka avec un esprit de\nvengeance envers les ex-Séléka est [sic] les sujets musulmans qui ont soutenu les\nSéléka durant leur occupation de la RCA. Avec la généralisation du mouvement\n« Anti-Balaka » à cette frange de population centrafricaine victime des Séléka, les\ndérapages sont constatés dans les rangs des Antibalaka en sachant que beaucoup de\ndélinquants et de déviants ont grossi les rangs du Mouvement.\nL’effectif global de ces Jeunes antibalaka est aujourd’hui évalué à environ 50.000\ncombattants, repartis sur les différents sites d’implantation du Mouvement à Bangui et\ndans l’arrière-pays.\nPour freiner et enrayer la propension aux dérapages des combattants Antibalaka\n« mélangés », le cantonnement, la prise en charge et l’alimentation des combattants\nAntibalaka constitue une urgente nécessité en vue de consolider le processus du\npacification et de normalisation en cours en République Centrafricaine.

With the “Anti-Balaka” movement expanding to\ninclude this section of the Central African population that had been victimized by the Seleka, excesses are observed\nin the ranks of the Anti-Balaka, knowing that many delinquents and deviants have swelled the ranks of the Movement.\nThe total headcount of these young Anti-Balaka is currently assessed at around 50,000 combatants, spread across the\nMovement’s various strongholds in Bangui and the provinces. To slow down and halt the inclination towards excesses\nby the “mixed” Anti-Balaka combatants, it is urgently necessary to billet, support and feed the Anti-Balaka combatants\nwith a view to consolidating the process of peace-keeping and normalization under way in the Central African\nRepublic.

Even if these\ngroups were, on the spot, joined by youth from the locality, their activities in the context of\nthe attack on Boda fell thus, by their coordinated actions, within the framework of one and\nthe same attack. Similarly, in relation to P-1962’s testimony that the threats by Dopani and\nothers in Boda were not necessarily implemented,5421 the Chamber notes that P-1962 also\nstated that the aggressive language of Dopani was used ‘from the very beginning’.5422\nP-1962 stated that the Anti-Balaka attack took place between 05:00 and 10:00 on 4 February\n2014.5423 P-1871 confirmed the attack as commencing early in the morning between 04:00\nand 05:00, as she was awoken in her home in Boda by her husband who heard gunshots and\ndiscovered that the Anti-Balaka was attacking after venturing outside to see what was\nhappening.5424\nThe evidence shows that the clashes ceased after the arrival of the Sangaris who coordinated\nwith the Red Cross to collect the bodies; 11 Muslims and three FACA and two Anti-Balaka\n5418 P-1962: T-138, p. 72, line 24 – p. 73, line 4.\n5419 Video, CAR-OTP-2066-5312; Transcript, CAR-OTP-2127-4504; Translation, CAR-OTP-2127-4593, at 4595-96,\nlines 30-40; Video, CAR-OTP-2060-0795; Transcript, CAR-OTP-2130-1370; Translation, CAR-OTP-2130-1236, at\n1237-38, lines 36-43; Press article, CAR-OTP-2001-4633.

For example, both witnesses gave a similar account of how\nAndjilo’s family members were killed by the Seleka and how Andjilo recuperated a firearm left behind by the Seleka\nduring a fight.

The\npurpose of the attack shared among the elements was to ‘get rid’ of the Seleka.\nThe Anti-Balaka elements gathered together and completed their final preparations in the\nnight of 4 December 2013 to begin the attack from all directions to enter Bangui by 5:00 on\n5 December 2013. They then carried out the attack along pre-decided routes, reaching the\ntarget locations and starting the offence at the same time. The Seleka repelled the attack\nsuccessfully, forcing the Anti-Balaka to retreat within a few hours.\nThe Chamber further recalls that later that day, on 5 December 2013, FROCCA issued a\nradio statement in relation to the attack on Bangui, referring to it as ‘[l]e rétablissement de\nl’ordre fonctionnel’ and stating that the Anti-Balaka ‘sont des Centrafricains pour aller\nlibérer leur pays des jougs des djihadistes venus du D[arfour], du T[chad], du S[oudan]’.6090\nThe Chamber finds that these attacks were highly coordinated despite claims of certain\nwitnesses that the various Anti-Balaka groups were independent, and came from\n‘everywhere’, not knowing each other, and did not have a political aim or agenda.6091\nFirst, the Chamber draws a distinction between (i) the coordinated nature of the Bangui\nAttack; (ii) the coordination of the Anti-Balaka as a movement; and (iii) the ‘national\ncoordination’ setup formally in the months after the Bangui Attack.\nThe Chamber grants that the existence of an underlying cohesive (or coordinated) movement\nof political ideology could have positively demonstrated a coordinated attack. The reverse is\nnot true. A political movement lacking in coordination does not demonstrate that individuals\nand groups cannot actualise coordinated action. Nonetheless, the Chamber has considered\nthe rhetoric of how uncoordinated the Anti-Balaka were as a movement prior to the Bangui\nAttack, but it did not change the Chamber’s conclusions that the attack itself was\ncoordinated.\n6090 See paragraph 1293 above.\n6091 See for example P-0876: T-086, p. 15, lines 16-24 ; p. 74, lines 10-17 ; T-088, p. 13, line 16 – p. 15, line 11; p. 17,\nlines 1-20, p. 19, lines 18-22; T-089, p. 16, lines 9-20, p. 19, line 18 – p. 20, line 17, p. 22, line 21 – p. 24, line 2; P-\n0808: T-070, p. 35, line 13 – p. 36, line 1.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 836/1616 24 July 2025",

While the evidence does\npoint to civilians self-organising in the provinces, there is a wealth of evidence showing that,\nat least as of November 2013, these civilians, together with FACA members, had been\nactively mobilised in preparation for an attack on Bangui. Indeed, a combined reading of the\nevidence in light of the Defence’s arguments demonstrates that the purported self-led\nmovement by civilians in the provinces was in fact channelled into common action by\nplacing on it a common task.\nThird, the Chamber notes that even P-0876, who claimed to there being ‘no coordination’\nfor the Bangui Attack in absolute terms also admitted to there being some organisation. P-\n0876 said that the Bangui Attack was ‘organised only by one group’, led by Konaté, and ‘not\nby all the Anti-Balaka groups’.6092\nIn this regard, the Chamber notes that P-0876 also appeared to be drawing a distinction\nbetween the coordination of the Anti-Balaka as a group and the coordinated nature of the\nBangui Attack. In his interview with the Prosecution, P-0876 said that he supposed that the\nBangui Attack was planned because spontaneity was excluded from the moment there were\nfive targets attacked at the same hour in the morning.6093 P-0876 explained in terms that the\nChamber finds fitting in this context:\nIl y a trop de concïdences. C’est pourqoui je suppose que ça a été planifié quelque\npart. […] Bon, si on disait: « Bon, un groupe a attaqué le matin vers 8 heures et\nd’autres ont été attaqués vers 11 heures [phon.] », là, on peut dire que : « Bon,\npeut… peut-être ça a suivi celui-là [phon.], ils ont vu que ça attaquait là-bas, on\npeut attaquer ici. » Mais c’etait le même jour, à la même heure, ils ont commencé\ntout…6094\n6092 P-0876: T-089, p. 23, line 16 – p. 24, line 2.

In this respect, the Chamber has considered several indicia\nbased on mutual assistance, cooperation, communication, and implementation within an\noverarching goal – all of which are shown to exist on the facts and prior to the Bangui Attack.\nTherefore, in the view of the Chamber, the setting up of the Anti-Balaka national\ncoordination formally only after 5 December 2013 did not mean that the Bangui Attack was\nnot coordinated.\nLastly in this respect, the Chamber considers that the coordinated nature of the Bangui\nAttack was not premised on its success. The Chamber finds that, on the basis of the totality\nof the evidence discussed above, the manner in which the Bangui Attack was organised and\ncarried out was highly coordinated. In this instance, even a failure to overpower the Seleka\nspoke to the unachieved yet common goals and targets.\n2. Involvement of Mr Yekatom\nMr Yekatom’s group coordinated with other Anti-Balaka groups to participate in the attack\non Bangui on 5 December 2013. In the months leading up to this attack, Mr Yekatom and\nhis group armed and trained in the bush. The movement of Mr Yekatom’s group in the bush,\nwhen superimposed onto those from other groups who proceeded towards Bangui along the\nsame time frame, shows that this coordination had begun well before November 2013.\nIn the afternoon of 4 December 2013, Mr Yekatom chose some of his elements and instructed\nthem to move towards Bangui. The same day, the group arrived in Projet, situated near the\nM’Poko airport in Bangui. Mr Yekatom’s instructions to his elements concerning the attack\non 5 December 2013 were to fight the Seleka and included targeting sectors where ‘Muslims’\nwere to be found. Mr Yekatom’s instructions were understood by the elements to accept that\nMuslim civilians would be killed as a result of the fighting based on his elements not having\nbeen trained or instructed to apply the principle of distinction during combat and bearing\nstrong anti-Muslim sentiment and feelings of vengeance against the Seleka.\nThe Prosecution submits that, for the Bangui Attack, Mr Yekatom and his group moved from\nKalangoi to Gbangba, and then to Projet, located near the Bangui Airport, on 4 December\nsomehow. […] Well, if you said: “Well, one group attacked at around 8:00 in the morning and others were attacked\nat around 11:00”, then you could say that: “Well, per… perhaps this one followed that one, they saw there was an\nattack over there, we can attack here”. But it was at the same time, on the same day, they started all…’\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 838/1616 24 July 2025",

P-2232 was not aware of a\nlink or a relationship between Maxime Mokom and Mr Yekatom prior to their time in Zongo\nbut acknowledged that they were both ‘liberators’, supporting François Bozizé when he took\npower in 2003.6120 At the time, P-2232 did not know Mr Yekatom, who was constantly with\nCœur de Lion and ‘Satan’, and so it was not possible for P-2232 to know with whom\nMr Yekatom discussed.6121 P-2232 heard afterwards [REDACTED] that Mr Yekatom, Cœur\nde Lion, and Satan had left Zongo through Libenge to Mongoumba, and he later heard that\nthey were in Mongoumba and from there went to Boeing behind the airport.6122\nThierry Tribunal Ndokobanda said that Mr Yekatom came to Zongo for ‘three or four days’,\nafter which he heard that the latter had appeared at Mbaïki and Mongoumba forming a\ngroup.6123 The witness did not know more of Mr Yekatom’s activities or who he was in\ncontact with in Zongo; and stated that Maxime Mokom never mentioned that they were in\ncontact.6124\nP-0884 denied discussing what Mr Yekatom was doing with Maxime Mokom and said that\nMaxime Mokom never talked to him about Mr Yekatom; according to P-0884, Maxime\nMokom was at the origin of Mr Yekatom’s arrest by the Congolese authorities,6125 and from\nwhat P-0884 got to know later, there was a misunderstanding between Mr Yekatom and\nMaxime Mokom.6126 P-0884 said it was clear that Maxime Mokom and Mr Yekatom were\nboth in Zongo and knew each other ‘very well’.6127\nthat rendered his account on this aspect wholly unreliable. The Chamber found P-1339’s account that these trips to\nprocure weapons indeed took place before 5 December 2013, involved members of Mr Yekatom’s group, and resulted\nin weapons being obtained for the group, which he unequivocally maintained in court, credible.\n6119 P-2232: T-075, p. 33, line 6 – p. 34, line 4.\n6120 P-2232: T-075, p. 37, lines 8-17.

The Chamber further\nconcludes that Mr Yekatom was aware that FACA members of his group, particularly Cœur\nde Lion, Habib Beina, Max Maidanda and Bodios, who also trained civilian elements, bore\nstrong anti-Muslim sentiments and feelings of vengeance against the Seleka. This extended\nto targeting Muslim civilians. The Chamber infers from the evidence elaborated here and\nelsewhere,6189 that this sentiment permeated the remainder of his group.\nThe Chamber further notes that Mr Yekatom’s group was designated to attack PK5, a\npredominantly Muslim neighbourhood. Therefore, the possibility that Mr Yekatom’s\nelements would target Muslim civilians in the upcoming attack was high. Despite this,\nMr Yekatom did not specify or clarify to his elements, the principles of distinction or its\nsignificance during their preparations and in advance of the attack. Accordingly, the\nChamber infers that Mr Yekatom knowingly did not instruct his elements to apply the\nprinciple of distinction.6190\nHaving regard to this, the Chamber finds that Mr Yekatom’s instructions were understood\nby the elements to accept that Muslim civilians would be killed as a result of the fighting\nbased on his elements not having been trained or instructed to apply the principle of\ndistinction during combat and bearing strong anti-Muslim sentiment and feelings of\nvengeance against the Seleka.\n6185 See paragraph 3158-3162, 3171-3172, 3232-3235 below.\n6186 See paragraph 2436 above.\n6187 See paragraph 2435 above.\n6188 See paragraphs 2430-2431 above.\n6189 See paragraphs 3089-3100, 3171-3172, 3137-3142 below.\n6190 See further paragraphs 2472-2474 below.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 851/1616 24 July 2025",

The Chamber has considered the Yekatom\nDefence’s submissions concerning Videos, CAR-OTP-2065-2544, CAR-OTP-2065-2841, that these videos show that\nMr Yekatom and Sylvestre Yagouzou are ‘not close’ and do not belong to the same group (see Annex A to Yekatom\nDefence Response to the “Prosecution’s Fourteenth Application for Submission of P-1819’s Evidence from the Bar\nTable”, ICC-01/14/01/18-2057-Conf, ICC-01/14-01/18-2233-Conf-AnxA, pp. 252-256 (CAR-OTP-2065-2544),\npp. 248-249 (CAR-OTP-2065-2841)). The Chamber has further considered the Yekatom Defence’s arguments that\nthe conversation in the former video ‘tends to show that the armament at the disposition of the group is quite limited\nas Mr Yekatom indicates they only have two rockets and are looking for a place that could have only four more’. The\nChamber notes that these videos demonstrate coordinating activities, including about procurement of arms, between\nthe two individuals and their respective groups, regardless of their arguable personal closeness or hierarchy.\n6226 P-1339: T-155, p. 75, line 16 – p. 78, line 17 referring to Video, CAR-OTP-2065-3220, at 00:00:00-00:03:20.\n6227 Translation, CAR-OTP-2127-3668, at 3670, lines 5-25.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 856/1616 24 July 2025",

P-1339 said that he was\nnot nearby when the chiefs talked among themselves and did not hear these ‘new\ninstructions’.6332 P-1339 recalled that the ‘attack’ started at 06:00 when they arrived in\nBangui and ‘the chief’ gave a signal.6333\nThe Chamber further recalls that P-1339 said that when they left the bush, it was ‘Rombhot’\nwho gave the instruction to ‘attack the Muslims and Seleka’ present at Boeing Market.6334\nP-1339 mentioned that while there were many Christians and fewer Muslims in the Boeing\nneighbourhood, the target was ‘where there were many Muslims’ and where they (‘we’) ‘put\nin a cross’ was ‘the Ali church’.6335\nP-1339 understood that they would attack ‘the market’ because ‘there were Muslims in that\nlocation’ and they had to start there in order to advance to PK5, which was the ‘goal of the\nAnti-Balaka’.6336 P-1339 understood that the first target was PK5, ‘where the Seleka were’,\n6331 See paragraphs 2465-2479 above. P-1339 made a sketch of the Boeing Market during his interview with the\nProsecution and which was discussed with him in court (see Sketch, CAR-OTP-2041-0767; paragraphs 2542-2544\nbelow).\n6332 P-1339: T-154, p. 36, line 22 – p. 38, line 24.\n6333 P-1339: T-154, p. 53, lines 14-19.

Progression of the attack\nElements in Mr Yekatom’s group killed Hassan Mahamat in the morning of 5 December\n2013 during the attack on the market in Boeing. Hassan personally interacted with certain\nSeleka officials prior to 5 December 2013 in his role as delegate of the male Muslim traders\nat the market in Boeing. Hassan had at least one weapon in his shop with which he fired in\nself-defence during the attack of 5 December 2013 carried out by Mr Yekatom’s elements.\nFurther, Mr Yekatom’s elements killed two unnamed Muslim traders at the market in\nBoeing during this attack. Traders at the market in Boeing and the Seleka personally\ninteracted with each other at the market and were seen by others as associating with each\nsuperiors asked me to bring them to the market, and I did, to look at the layout.

The Chamber also\nconsiders that the traders were suspected to have weapons in their shops, but no evidence\npoints to these weapons being used on 5 December 2013 by the unnamed Muslim\nvictims.6457\nAs regards the Boeing Market traders’ link with the Seleka, the Chamber has considered the\nevidence provided by P-1339, P-8884, P-2682, Brice Emotion Namsio, Salehou Ndiaye and\nGaston Sallo.\nIn addition to what P-1339 said about the links between Hassan and the Seleka,6458 the\nwitness said that when the Seleka arrived, ‘they had the habit of coming to the Boeing market\nand to park their cars in front of his shop, and that is how sometimes he gave them tea’,\nwhich is ‘how the population regarded those shopkeepers as accomplices of the Seleka’.6459\nP-1339 confirmed that the Boeing population was very angry towards Hassan and the\nshopkeepers.6460 When asked whether a number of shop owners supported the Seleka, as\nindicated in his previous statement, P-1339 responded that the shopkeepers in the Boeing\nMarket were represented by Hassan, and ‘since he committed the act, […] [he] refer[red] to\n“some of the shop owners”’.6461\n6457 See also paragraph 2571 above.\n6458 See paragraphs 2558-2559 above.\n6459 P-1339: T-154, p. 50, lines 14-19.\n6460 P-1339: T-157, p. 19, lines 10-17.\n6461 P-1339: T-157, p. 20, line 23 – p. 21, line 3.

The Chamber recalls that Mr Yekatom is charged with\n‘directing an attack against a building dedicated to religion’ pursuant to Article 8(2)(e)(iv)\nof the Statute. In the view of the Chamber, whether and by whom the Boeing Mosque was\nlater destroyed, dismantled, or otherwise taken apart, is not material to the charges.\nIndeed, P-1339 drew a similar distinction during his testimony between the attack to the\nmosque – which he attributed to Mr Yekatom’s group – and its subsequent destruction or\ndismantling – which he said was carried out by the civilian population. In the view of the\nChamber, this explains why P-1339, when repeatedly asked who destroyed the mosque, said\nthat it was the civilian population, while at the same time maintained that it was\nMr Yekatom’s group that attacked the mosque. For example, and as discussed in further\ndetail below, P-1339 confirmed that he had told the Prosecution that ‘Alkanto shot a rocket’\nand the walls were ‘destroyed by the population’.6519\nImportantly, the Chamber considers that the subsequent destruction or taking apart of the\nBoeing Mosque by the population does not, in any way, exclude the possibility that\nMr Yekatom’s group attacked it first.\nIn light of this, the Chamber considers without merit the Yekatom Defence’s submissions\nthat P-1339 initially stated that Mr Yekatom’s group were ‘not involved in the destruction\nof the Boeing Mosque’ and thereafter reversed his version.6520 Likewise, it considers without\nmerit the Yekatom Defence’s submissions that ‘P-1339’s testimony in regard to ‘the\ndestruction of the Boeing Mosque’ contains two irreconcilable accounts: one that would put\n6518 Yekatom Defence Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2737-Corr-Red, para. 413.\n6519 P-1339: T-160, p. 23, lines 15-23, p. 27, line 12 – p. 28, line 5.

Indeed, P-1339\nindicated that he saw how the local population ‘destroyed’ the Boeing Mosque as the group\nwithdrew, but at no point indicated that the mosque was fully destroyed that day. Regarding\nD29-4011’s claim that the Boeing Mosque was intact when she arrived to her house on the\nday she witnessed the destruction of the mosque, the Chamber notes that while the witness\nstated that she passed by the ‘église néo-apostolique’ – located close to the Boeing Mosque\n–,6564 she did not specifically state that she walked close to or by the mosque or paid any\nparticular attention to it.6565 The Chamber further notes that from her house, D29-4011 did\nnot seem to have full visibility of the entirety of the mosque’s building.6566 It is therefore of\nthe view that D29-4011’s account does not contradict that of P-1339 nor that of Gaston Sallo.\nIn this respect, the Chamber has also considered the evidence of other witnesses who\nindicated that ‘the Anti-Balaka’, together with the civilian population, ‘destroyed’ the\nBoeing Mosque.6567\nThe Chamber now turns to the impact of the attack on the Boeing Mosque. The Chamber\nnotes that Salehou Ndiaye provided the following explanation when asked how the memories\nof the Boeing Mosque emotionally affected him:\nIt’s difficult to explain what I feel within.

The same holds true for Brice Emotion Namsio, who\nstated that some of Mr Yekatom’s elements were in Boeing on that day and ‘attacked’ KM5\nand PK9.6628 P-1521 did not have direct or accurate information about Mr Yekatom’s group\nor the ‘Boeing team’ that attacked on the ‘6th or the 7th’ of December 2013.6629 Asked ‘who\nled the Boeing group’, P-1521 recalled certain names generally, including Ngremangou,\nMr Yekatom, Sylvestre Yagouzou, Sebastien Wenezoui, Bertin Nganabeam, Bama Clement\nand Modibo; and said that on the 5th, 6th, or the 7th, ‘we did not have any contact with\nthem’.6630 The Chamber also has regard to P-0889’s evidence concerning the presence of\ncertain Anti-Balaka in Boeing, including Modibo Honoré, Yvon Donoh, Sylvestre\nYagouzou, and Sébastien Wenezoui.6631 P-0889, asked specifically if these groups were in\nBoeing ‘before’ 5 December 2013, said that he could not confirm and that he would not have\nknown if they were there, because he was in Zongo at the time; he clarified that his sketch\n6624 Yekatom Defence Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2737-Corr-Red, para. 367.\n6625 Yekatom Defence Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2737-Corr-Red, para. 373.\n6626 P-0884: T-057, p. 20, line 5 – p. 21, line 3.\n6627 P-0884: T-057, p. 21, lines 9-20.\n6628 P-0446 Interview Transcript, CAR-OTP-2059-1672-R02, at 1690-92, lines 676-766.

Dislocation of Muslims from Boeing and Cattin\nFrom 5 December 2013 onwards, the majority of Muslims of Boeing and Cattin, including\nSalehou Ndiaye and P-2682, fled to PK5 in Bangui, while some others fled to other parts of\nthe CAR, in the context of the attack by Mr Yekatom’s group on Boeing and Cattin. Muslim\npersons who fled to PK5 continued to fear for their security because of the presence of the\nAnti-Balaka around PK5 and Bangui generally. With the influx of Muslims fleeing the attack\non Bangui on 5 December 2013, PK5 became overcrowded, practically uninhabitable, and\n6632 P-0889: T-111, p. 12, lines 6-22 referring to Sketch, CAR-OTP-2027-2311.\n6633 Prosecution Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2738-Red, para. 567 referring to Compilation, CAR-OTP-2088-\n1198, at 1218.\n6634 Yekatom Defence Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2737-Corr-Red, paras 385-386.\n6635 P-1339: T-155, p. 22, lines 12-17.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 912/1616 24 July 2025",

As a result, some Muslims, including Salehou Ndiaye and P-2682, then fled to\nneighbouring countries fearing for their safety.\nThe Chamber notes that the Prosecution points to two sets of events attributed to\nMr Yekatom’s group that led the Muslims to flee from Boeing and Cattin on 5 December\n2013 to PK5. First, Mr Yekatom’s ‘attack against the Muslim civilian population of B[oeing]\nand C[attin] on 5 December 2013’.6636 Second, ‘the crimes that his elements continued to\ncommit, under his leadership, against this population’ while based at Yamwara.6637 The\nProsecution submits that Muslims from Boeing and Cattin fled to PK5 as this was ‘the only\nsafe place’ for them in Bangui, and to other parts of the CAR and neighbouring countries.6638\nThe Prosecution submits that most of the displaced Muslims at PK5 were eventually\nevacuated to neighbouring countries, including Chad and Cameroon, in convoys secured by\nheavy military escorts.6639 The Prosecution argues that the ‘forced departure of the Muslim\ncivilian population from Bangui’ was one of the ‘objectives’ of the Anti-Balaka who took\npart in the attack, including Mr Yekatom and his group.6640\nThe Chamber will first address the evidence concerning Muslims fleeing Boeing and Cattin\nto PK5 and then turn to Muslims fleeing to other parts of the CAR and neighbouring\ncountries.\nBefore turning to its assessment, the Chamber recalls that PK5 is in the\n3rd arrondissement.6641 It is located next to Boeing neighbourhood with Cattin falling in\nbetween Boeing and PK5.6642\nIn its assessment, the Chamber has considered evidence from witnesses, who were familiar\nwith these locations, namely, Salehou Ndiaye, P-2682, P-1339 and P-0884.

These fears were subsequently reinforced by the information\nreceived from and assistance provided by his Christian neighbours.\nIn the case of Salehou Ndiaye’s family members and ‘other local Muslims’, who fled Cattin,\nthe Chamber finds that these persons also fled because of the attacks on the Boeing Mosque\nand Cattin, which took place during the Bangui Attack. The Chamber notes that while this\nmove only occurred three or four days after the events in Cattin, it finds that it was\nnonetheless because of the events in Cattin during the Bangui Attack. Salehou Ndiaye noted\nspecifically that these persons left only when the French Sangaris were present in the area\nand the Anti-Balaka had retreated. In the same vein, the Chamber has also considered that\nthe witness stated that after news on the killing of Muslim traders at the Boeing Market\n6652 P-1528 First Statement, CAR-OTP-2048-0757-R05, at 0764, para. 39.\n6653 P-1528 First Statement, CAR-OTP-2048-0757-R05, at 0764, para. 40.\n6654 P-1528 First Statement, CAR-OTP-2048-0757-R05, at 0764, para. 40.\n6655 P-1528 First Statement, CAR-OTP-2048-0757-R05, at 0764, para. 40.

When asked about\nhis source of information, Salehou Ndiaye explained that when they were in the hangar, people talked and said that\n‘the Anti-Balaka’ could be doing a ‘cleansing operation’ and ‘sort out the Muslims’ that night, and while these were\nrumours and it was impossible to check the information, it was best to take precautions (see P-1528: T-178, p. 31, line\n24 – p. 32, line 23).\n6656 See paragraph 2620 above.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 915/1616 24 July 2025",

Conclusion\nOn the basis of the above, the Chamber finds that the majority of Muslims, including Salehou\nNdiaye and P-2682, fled Boeing and Cattin to PK5, while some others fled to other parts of\nthe CAR, in the context of the attack by Mr Yekatom’s group on Boeing and Cattin. Muslim\npersons who fled to PK5 continued to fear for their security because of the presence of the\nAnti-Balaka around PK5 and Bangui generally. With the influx of Muslims fleeing the attack\non Bangui on 5 December 2013, PK5 became overcrowded, uninhabitable, and unsafe. As a\nresult, some Muslims, including Salehou Ndiaye and P-2682, then fled to neighbouring\ncountries fearing for their safety. In this regard, the Chamber recalls the abundant evidence\non the case record pointing to the massive displacement of the Muslim population of Bangui\nto PK5 and to other parts within and outside of the CAR, in the context of the Bangui Attack.\nDuring this period, the people who fled endured the loss of their family members, loss of\ntheir home, loss of their belongings, and sense of material and non-material unsafety for\nprolonged periods. During their stay in PK5, they lived through uninhabitable living\nconditions that aggravated this loss.

Rather, based on the testimony of P-2049 [REDACTED],6804 the Chamber concludes\nthat the Seleka briefly had a temporary base in or around Boro school in September 2013.\n1. Unfolding of the attack on Bossangoa on 5 December 2013\nOn 5 December 2013, in coordination with the Anti-Balaka attack on Bangui on the same\nday, Anti-Balaka elements, divided into two groups led by Florent Kema and Théophile\nNdangba, respectively, carried out an attack on the town of Bossangoa. The attack started\nat approximately 13:00 and lasted until the late afternoon or early evening.\nDuring the attack, the Anti-Balaka targeted residential areas, including the Boro\nneighbourhood, generally known as the Muslim neighbourhood in Bossangoa, with the\nintention of showing that the Anti-Balaka were attacking not only Bangui but also in the\nprovinces, and to ‘free’ the town from Seleka and all Muslims, thereby targeting Muslim\ncivilians and drawing no distinction between them and the Seleka. During the attack, the\nAnti-Balaka was well armed, with some AK-47s and RPGs, as well as hunting weapons.\nFor the factual findings in this section, the Chamber relies primarily on the evidence of the\nfollowing witnesses which, subject to discrete aspects discussed below, it finds particularly\nreliable: Jo-Brice Ouabiro Dana and P-2602, the Anti-Balaka insiders who participated in\nthe Bossangoa Attack; P-2462, P-2657, P-2049 and P-2200, Muslim civilians who were\nliving in Bossangoa during the events.\ni. Arrival in Bossangoa\nThe Anti-Balaka from Gobere arrived near Bossangoa a few days before the Bossangoa\nAttack. Jo-Brice Ouabiro Dana, an Anti-Balaka element who participated in the Bossangoa\nAttack, stated that he was secretary for chief Alexis Mandago (also known as ‘Sol Sol’),6805\nwho told them that their group was going with Florent Kema and Ndangba to Bossangoa.6806\nThe witness testified that the Anti-Balaka arrived 30 kilometres away from Bossangoa\nbetween 2 and 3 December 2013 and, as they did not expect to attack Bossangoa on\n5 December, had a three-day fast to ask for God’s blessings prior to fighting.6807\n6804 P-2049: T-102, p. 18, line 21 – p. 19, line 5 (the witness explained that the Seleka had a base at the École mixte\nde Boro for a maximum of two days).\n6805 P-0966 Statement, CAR-OTP-2031-0241-R03, at 0251, para. 58.\n6806 P-0966: T-117-ENG, p. 34, line 24 – p. 35, line 17; T-117-FRA, p. 36, line 27 – p. 37, line 21.\n6807 P-0966: T-116, p. 41, line 11 – p. 42, line 12.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 937/1616 24 July 2025",

The Chamber notes in this regard that during his\ntestimony, Jo-Brice Ouabira Dana seemed to provide an answer, as recorded in the French transcript, which may be\nread as negating that liberating the Christians was one of the motives to attack Bossangoa (see P-0966: T-117-FRA,\np. 60, lines 5-9). The English transcript reads less ambiguous in its context (see P-0966: T-117-ENG, p. 56, lines 22-\n24).

He confirmed that\narms could have been hidden in the mosque, and further stated that the rule was that Muslims cannot enter the mosque\nwith weapons and knives, but no one had the power to prevent the Seleka officials from entering the mosque with\nweapons (see P-2049: T-103, p. 45, line 15 – p. 46, line 5).

The Chamber will address these arguments in turn.\nFirst, the Ngaïssona Defence argues that the incident of rape with which Mr Ngaïssona is\ncharged has not been established beyond reasonable doubt,7016 due to issues with P-2462’s\ncredibility on the basis of inconsistencies in her and with P-2657’s account as well as\n‘implausible’ circumstances regarding the rape,7017 and the authenticity of the medical\nreports which the witness provided.7018\nIn relation to the first alleged inconsistency, regarding the location where P-2462 was\nstopped by the Anti-Balaka before being taken to the [REDACTED],7019 the Chamber notes\nthat the witness initially stated she was [REDACTED] when a group of five ‘Balaka’ came\nin and threatened her,7020 while later clarifying that she was [REDACTED] where she was\nraped.7021 The Chamber finds this inconsistency minor.\nIn relation to the alleged inconsistencies between the accounts of P-2462 and P-2657, the\nNgaïssona Defence argues that (i) P-2462 said she [REDACTED]7022 while the latter did not\n[REDACTED],7023 and (ii) P-2657 stated [REDACTED],7024 while P-2462 said\n[REDACTED].7025\nAs regards the first point, the Chamber notes that although one witness mentioned fleeing\nwith the other while the other did not mention the first, both witnesses stated seeing each\nother on the same day.

These arguments of the Ngaïssona Defence\ntherefore fail on the basis of the evidence.\nIn this context, the Chamber also notes the Ngaïssona Defence’s suggestion that the fighting\nwould have been ‘particularly intense’ at the imam’s house, for which reason ‘it is\nimpossible to discount the possibility that the alleged victims might have been unfortunately\nkilled in cross or friendly fire’.7060 First, the Chamber recalls P-1577’s evidence according\nto which the closest Seleka base in relation to the imam’s residence was three to four\nkilometres away,7061 and that indeed he did not see any Seleka close to the imam’s house\n[REDACTED],7062 as well as its finding that the Seleka base at Boro school was there only\ntemporarily during September 2013.7063 Second, the Chamber recalls that while P-1577 saw\nSeleka driving in the direction of the imam’s residence, he could not say if they in fact went\nthere.7064 Third, the Chamber finds that P-1577’s reference to an ‘intense battle’ in the area\nof the imam’s house was made in relation to the number of spent cartridges he found on the\nground, the bullet holes in walls, and the blood spatter on ground and walls a few days after\nthe attack,7065 and not because he was aware of a battle taking place at that location.

Specifically, Lars Bromley, expert from UNOSAT, concluded that a tent\nencampment with over 95 shelters which was not visible in the image from 4 December 2013\nhad appeared by 12 December 2013.7356 According to the witness’s analysis, the shelters on\nthe school grounds which had appeared by 12 December 2013 grew in number by 8 January\n7352 Press article, CAR-2079-1159 (dated 14 January 2014, stating that since the first Anti-Balaka attacks in September\nand following reprisals by the Seleka, the number of internally displaced people in the two main camps multiplied,\nwith around 4,000 Muslims taking refuge at a school). The Chamber notes that the Ngaïssona Defence argued this\nitem has limited probative value due to the lack of clarity on how the information was collected and the hearsay nature\nof most of its content (see Annex 1 to Defence Response to the “Prosecution’s Eleventh Application for the\nSubmission of Open-source Evidence from the Bar Table” ICC-01/14-01/18-2010-Conf, ICC-01/14-01/18-2114-\nConf-Anx1, p. 28).

In relation to the latter item, the\nChamber notes that the Ngaïssona Defence argued it lacks probative value and authenticity (see Annex A to Defence\nResponse to “Prosecution’s Fifteenth submission of miscellaneous items of evidence via the “bar table”” ICC-01/14-\n01/18-2058, ICC-01/14-01/18-2084-Conf-AnxA, pp. 16-17).

They provide that ‘[s]ince July 2013, several hundred displaced Muslim civilians sought shelter\nwithin the main buildings of a local school (Ecole Liberté) in the Muslim Boro quarter of Bossangoa’ and that ‘[t]he\nnumber of displaced in Boro dramatically increased when over 7,000 local Muslims residents sought emergency\nshelter and protection at the school which was heavily protected by African Union troops and the ex-Seleka fighters\nat the time’. The satellite image of 4 December 2013 shows four buildings in the centre that are spaced out and in\nfront of one of the buildings is a blueish rectangular object. The satellite image of 12 December 2013 shows numerous\nblue and white rectangular objects between and around the buildings. The Chamber notes that in relation of Report,\nCAR-OTP-2005-0197, the Ngaïssona Defence noted that the satellite images were not put to a satellite imagery expert,\nand that the absence of sources and methodology deprives the Chamber from any possibility to assess the item’s\nreliability (see Annex 1 to Defence Response to the “Prosecution’s Eleventh Application for the Submission of Open-\nsource Evidence from the Bar Table” ICC-01/14-01/18-2010-Conf, ICC-01/14-01/18-2114-Conf-Anx1, pp. 16-17).\nThe Chamber considers in this regard that it has assessed the information in this report only within the context of the\nevidence provided by a satellite imagery expert, as described.

The Muslim civilians at the École de la Liberté were dependent on\nthe protection of international forces for their safety and could not leave the school premises\nventuring into Bossangoa without risk to their person.\nIn the period following the Bossangoa Attack, and until their transportation from Bossangoa\nin February and April 2014, as discussed further below, the Muslim inhabitants of Bossangoa\nthat had sought refuge at the École de la Liberté were confined to the school premises in fear\nof threats by the Anti-Balaka.\nAt the outset, the Chamber recalls its analysis above according to which part of the Anti-\nBalaka groups remained in Bossangoa following the Bossangoa Attack.7380 Even if the Anti-\nBalaka were not in control of the town completely, the Chamber finds without merit the\nNgaïssona Defence’s suggestion that the Anti-Balaka retreated from Bossangoa on 5\nDecember 2013 and therefore could not have posed a direct threat or exercise any control\nover Muslim civilians at the École de la Liberté.7381\nIndeed, the evidence before the Chamber shows the contrary.

The\nwitness said that they would provide ‘advice’ and train the elements at Yamwara on\ninternational humanitarian law and show the elements what to do on the battlefield ‘while\nrespecting international humanitarian law’ and various other kinds of training tactics,7658 and\nthat this was consistent with the training that he had himself received as a FACA member.7659\n7653 P-1786: T-197, p. 75, line 3 – p. 76, line 1, p. 76, line 25 – p. 77, line 2.

The Chamber found\nthem generally reliable and credible.\nThe Chamber considered the discrepancies within and among these testimonies concerning\nthe Yamwara Incident which are discussed in detail below.7677 In this regard, the Chamber\nappreciates the time that has elapsed since the Yamwara Incident and its traumatic nature,\nand is of the view that a majority of these inconsistencies were either minor or did not\nconcern facts material to the allegations. Therefore, they did not undermine the credibility\nof these witnesses generally. On the contrary, these inconsistencies, when assessed in their\ntotality, suggested to the Chamber that the witnesses’ accounts were genuine and not\nrehearsed, or otherwise agreed upon prior to their testimony before the Chamber, contrary\nto the Yekatom Defence allegations concerning contamination. In places, where these\ndiscrepancies did concern material factual allegations, these have been discussed in detail\nbelow.\nHaving regard to this, the Chamber turns to the specific Yekatom Defence allegations\nconcerning contamination of the evidence.

The witnesses were able to explain the\ncircumstances of their meeting with the Prosecution, including how some accompanied each\nother for the interview. While P-1811 said that P-0967 called her about giving a statement\nto the Prosecution, P-0967, in turn, did not recall who had called her to be interviewed by\nthe Prosecution, while understanding that P-1654 had approached the investigators.7716 P-\n0967 stated having heard some information from the other witnesses,7717 but was open about\nthe source of her knowledge. The Chamber has taken it into account when evaluating her\nevidence. Further, P-1704, P-1705, and P-1716 confirmed that they were interviewed\nindividually by the Prosecution.7718 Overall, the Chamber finds that there is nothing in the\nrespective witnesses’ testimonies which suggests that they would have agreed with any of\nthe other witnesses on certain facts in advance of their respective interviews.\nSimilarly, social media contacts between P-1704, P-1705 and P-1716, as brought out during\ntheir testimony before the court, did not reveal that these contacts had any bearing on their\ntestimony about the Yamwara Incident before the Chamber. In this regard, the Chamber\nnotes that P-1705 could recognise P-1716’s Facebook profile;7719 P-1705 and P-1704\nexchanged comments and likes on Facebook.7720 P-1705 could recognise P-1704’s Facebook\npage and appeared in one of P-1704’s photos.7721 P-1704’s Facebook profile page shows that\nhe is friends with P-1705 on Facebook.7722\nThird, and more importantly, given that the witnesses had a shared traumatic experience and\nspoke about it with each other afterwards, it is inevitable and indeed natural that their\n7716 P-1811: T-115, p. 26, line 22 – p. 27, line 23; P-0967: T-200, p. 61, lines 9-17.\n7717 See for example P-0967: T-200, p. 62, lines 10-17.\n7718 P-1704: T-128, p. 56, line 18 – p. 57, line 3; P-1705: T-212, p. 56, line 17 – p. 57, line 2. P-1716 said that he held\nback on talking with the Prosecution investigators at that point in time (see P-1716: T-148, p. 36, lines 8-16).\nAccording to P-1704, P-1716 was ‘scared’ and refused to have another meeting, he did not have any support and did\nnot want to talk about the Anti-Balaka attack (see P-1704: T-128, p. 68, lines 4-15). The Chamber notes that P-1704,\nP-1705, and P-1716 were indeed interviewed on different days. P-1716’s statement mentions that he was interviewed\non 29 April 2017 and between 29 April 2017 and 5 May 2017 (see P-1716 Statement, CAR-OTP-2053-0062-R05, at\n0062). Whereas P-1705, asked about his meeting with the Prosecution investigators on 30 April 2017 and 1 May 2017,\nstated that he went there by himself and not with [REDACTED] (see P-1705: T-212, p. 4, line 15-17, p. 54, line 23 –\np. 55, line 2).

The Chamber has\ntaken these factors into account when assessing their evidence holistically, in light of the\ndiscrepancies that emerged during their testimonies.\nThe Chamber also notes that the witnesses were able to point out when they were speaking\nfrom personal experience and when they had received information from another witness. It\nwas telling that the witnesses acknowledged the fact that they had received information from\neach other, and specifically explained when and from whom the information was\nreceived.7723 This permitted the Chamber to assess the witnesses’ respective testimony in\nlight of their contacts with other witnesses when reaching conclusions.\nLastly in this respect, the Chamber has had due regard to the passage of time in assessing\nthe evidence concerning traumatic events. The Five Witnesses were testifying approximately\nten years after the events, and it is understandable that they did not recall all the details with\nprecision.\nNotwithstanding these general observations, when the Yekatom Defence’s arguments\nconcern specific factual allegations, the Chamber has assessed them below.\nOn 24 December 2013, following the death of a member of the Lapo N’Gomat family, Saint\nCyr’s older brother, three women related to the family were to be escorted back to their\nhome before dark because of the security situation in Bangui at the time. The four men,\nnamely P-1704, P-1705, P-1716 and Saint Cyr, who were relatives and friends of the Lapo\nN’Gomat family, escorted the three women, namely, P-0967, P-1811 and another (together,\nseven persons), to the main road to find them a taxi.\nThe Chamber notes that Saint Cyr’s [REDACTED] elder brother, Charlemagne Lapo\nN’Gomat had passed away at the Castor hospital on the early morning of 24 December\n7723 See e.g. P-1811 Statement, CAR-OTP-2058-0003-R05, at 0009, para. 36 stating that P-1704 told her at the M’Poko\nsite that the Anti-Balaka found Saint Cyr’s FACA identity card; P-0967: T-199, p. 50, lines 6-17 where P-0967 stated\nthat P-1704 spoke to her that both ears of Saint Cyr had been cut off; P-1705: T-212, p. 26, lines 14-18 where P-1705\nsaid that P-1654 told him about the Lapo family being exterminated if the base would be attacked and P-1705 denying\nhaving heard this personally; P-0967: T-200, p. 29, line 4 – p. 30, line 2 where P-0967 said that after reading a\ndocument from P-1654, she did not understood how P-1716 was at the base since she saw him sent away at the\ncheckpoint and because she did not see him at the base; P-0967: T-200, p. 35, lines 18-23 where she said that she read\nthe document drafted by P-1654 and made modifications to her statement.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 1050/1616 24 July 2025",

P-1705 described the\nvehicle as a BG-80, a Hilux Toyota that they got in at Castor Hospital and called it a Castor ambulance. P-0967 did\nnot speak of a brand but said that it bore the sign ‘ambulance de Boali’ and they took it at Castor Hospital; and that it\nwas not a Red Cross vehicle. P-1716, on the other hand, thought that it was a Red Cross ambulance (see P-1705: T-\n212, p. 14, lines 7-20 compared with P-0967: T-199, p. 29, line 15 – p. 33, line 18; P-1716 Statement, CAR-OTP-\n2053-0062-R05, at 0066, para. 23). Other witnesses generally referred to it as an ambulance without specifying the\nmake or the brand (see P-1704: T-128, p. 31, lines 12-21; P-1704 Statement, CAR-OTP-2054-1136-R05, at 1140,\npara. 23; P-1811 Statement, CAR-OTP-2058-0003-R05, at 0006, para. 19). Given the time that has passed since the\nincident, the Chamber finds that the witnesses’ recollection, or lack thereof, of the vehicle in question has no bearing\non their credibility generally about this aspect of their evidence.\n7728 P-1811: T-115, p. 5, line 20 – p. 6, line 2, p. 7, lines 7-13; P-1716: T-148, p. 14, lines 9-15; P-1704: T-128, p. 31,\nline 12 – p. 32, line 2; P-1716: T-148, p. 15, lines 6-23, p. 18, line 25 – p. 19, line 7; P-1811 Statement, CAR-OTP-\n2058-0003-R05, at 0006, paras 18-22; P-1716 Statement, CAR-OTP-2053-0062-R05, at 0066, paras 22-23; P-1704\nStatement, CAR-OTP-2054-1136-R05, at 1140, para. 23. The Chamber notes that some witnesses testified about being\nstopped at Seleka checkpoints when passing through PK5 to Boeing. However, P-1705 denied going through any\nSeleka roadblocks in PK5 but was clear in stating that they were stopped at ‘Avicom’, which is close to Yamwara (see\nP-1705: T-212, p. 15, lines 15-19). P-1811 also denied that they went through Seleka checkpoints (see P-1811: T-115,\np. 10, line 17 – p. 11, line 3). The Chamber also notes that there appears to be a discrepancy between the accounts on\nwhere and how many times the vehicle had to stop at checkpoints along the way. However, the Chamber considers\nthat these details are not material to the factual allegations concerning the Yamwara Incident, neither is the number of\ntimes the vehicle was stopped before it arrived in Boeing. The Chamber has also considered that P-0967 seemed to\nthink that no one stopped them along the way and also did not appear to remember well who was sitting in the vehicle.\nHowever, the Chamber notes that she was sitting behind in the ambulance and said that it was very difficult to see\nwhat was happening outside (see P-0967: T-200, p. 25, lines 8-14, p. 30, lines 2-19). Further, given the time that has\npassed and P-0967’s general coherence and detailed description of the subsequent events, the Chamber considers her\naccount on this aspect not materially discrepant from those of others.\n7729 P-1705: T-211, p. 13, line 9 – p. 14, line 6; T-212, p. 15, lines 15-19; P-1704: T-128, p. 32, lines 14-25; P-1811\nStatement, CAR-OTP-2058-0003-R05, at 0006, para. 20.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 1051/1616 24 July 2025",

Some of them recognised this location as the same as where the\nambulance was stopped earlier that day, near ‘Avicom’ and about 300-400 metres from the Lapo N’Gomat family\nhouse (see P-1704: T-128, p. 10, line 11 – p. 12, line 8, p. 35, lines 17-22; P-1704 Statement, CAR-OTP-2054-1136-\nR05, at 1141, para. 26; P-1705: T-212, p. 14, line 22 – p. 15, line 19, p. 16, lines 6-9, p. 18, line 9 – p. 19, line 3, p. 22,\nline 24 – p. 23, line 8; P-1716: T-148, p. 18, lines 16-24; P-1716 Statement, CAR-OTP-2053-0062-R05, at 0066-67,\npara. 26; P-1811: T-114, p. 14, lines 5-14, p. 15, lines 18-22; P-1811: T-115, p. 8, line 14 – p. 9, line 22; P-1811\nStatement, CAR-OTP-2058-0003-R05, at 0007, para. 23).

However, it argues that it was P-1811’s\npresence, P-0967 and P-1811’s ‘ties to Djotodia’, together with a group of ‘unrecognisable\nindividuals from outside the neighbourhood’ that ‘aroused reasonable suspicion’ amongst\nAlkanto’s elements,7750 and not because the group was identifiable as Muslim.7751\n7744 P-1716: T-147, p. 7, lines 7-23.\n7745 P-1704: T-128, p. 35, lines 2-11.\n7746 The Chamber notes that some witnesses at the time did not seem to know Alkanto’s name. However, when read\ntogether with P-1839’s testimony, the Chamber finds that the person they were referring to as the ‘leader’ of this group\nat this post is a reference to Alkanto. P-0967 and P-1811 used the words ‘leader’ and ‘chief’ whereas P-1705 used the\nterm ‘in charge of the roadblock’ (P-0967: T-199, p. 33, line 19 – p. 35, line 14; P-1811 Statement, CAR-OTP-2058-\n0003-R05, at 0007, paras 23, 25; P-1811: T-114, p. 15, lines 9-17, p. 16, lines 6-14, p. 18, lines 4-8; P-1705: T-211,\np. 21, lines 12-15). P-1716 did not know who the leader of the roadblock was but found out when he arrived in\nYamwara (see P-1716: T-148, p. 25, line 19 – p. 26, line 2). In addition to this, the Chamber has also considered that\nP-1704 indicated in his prior recorded testimony that he heard the ‘Anti-Balaka’ using the name ‘Alkanto’ to call him\n(see P-1704 Statement, CAR-OTP-2054-1136-R05, at 1141, para. 27). P-1704 said in court that Alkanto introduced\nhimself to the group (see P-1704: T-128, p. 12, lines 9-17). The Chamber further notes that P-1704, P-1705, and P-\n0967 were shown Video, CAR-OTP-2065-4585, at 00:00:03 depicting a man with braided hair wearing a green and\nwhite striped t-shirt with gris-gris across the chest standing outside in a bush with several men standing around him,\nwho appears to be Alkanto. P-0967 said that she thought that the person with braids was the one that stopped them,\nmentioning that it was very difficult to recognise him clearly since she only saw him once (see P-0967: T-200, p. 41,\nlines 11-18). P-1704 and P-1705 did not recognise him (see P-1704: T-128, p. 36, line 24 – p. 37, line 21; P-1705: T-\n212, p. 48, lines 1-9). In the Chamber’s view, P-1704’s and P-1705’s inability to recognise Alkanto in this video does\nnot affect the credibility of their testimony about him.

All\nwitnesses remembered Alkanto saying out loud that he had previously worked with\nMamour.7760 Some of them remembered that Alkanto also spoke about his friend having\nbeen mistreated by the Mamour family and wanting revenge.7761\nBased on this and what follows, the Chamber finds that it was a combination of Alkanto’s\nnegative feelings centred around a desire for revenge, the women being identified as related\nto Djotodia and Mamour, as well as being Muslims, that predisposed Alkanto’s group to\ntheir perception of the seven persons. This was despite the fact that the men in the group\nwere non-Muslims.\nFollowing Alkanto’s identification of the women, his elements started to threaten the group\nwith death, telling the group that they would be ‘skinned like a papaya’.

In fact, the nature and the purpose of them being\ntogether and close to Yamwara was linked to the funeral of Saint Cyr’s older brother, as set\nout above.\nAfter threatening them with death and accusing them of being traitors, Alkanto ordered his\nelements to take the seven persons, including Saint Cyr Lapo N’Gomat, P-1704, P-1705, P-\n1716, P-0967 and P-1811, to Yamwara.\nFollowing this search, according to P-1811, Alkanto spoke on the phone with ‘the person of\nauthority’ from the base to say that he had arrested Djotodia’s family members.7780 P-1811\nsaid that she knew that Alkanto called their ‘chief’ because when he finished the phone call,\nhe told them that the ‘chief’ had ordered that they be taken to the base.7781\nThe Chamber is not a position to conclude whether, at this stage of the events, Alkanto called\nCœur de Lion or Mr Yekatom. P-1811 seemed to think that it was Mr Yekatom, because\nMr Yekatom later introduced himself as the ‘chief’.7782 P-1839, on the other hand, did not\nknow whether Alkanto called Cœur de Lion before sending the group to Yamwara,7783 but\n7778 P-1716: T-147, p. 7, line 24 – p. 8, line 7; P-1704 Statement, CAR-OTP-2054-1136-R05, at 1141, para. 29. The\nChamber notes that a person called ‘[REDACTED]’, who had accompanied the seven persons thus far, but who had\nno relation to the Lapo N’Gomat family by blood or marriage, was allowed to leave the group at this stage (see P-\n1704: T-128, p. 38, line 24 – p. 39, line 6; P-1705: T-212, p. 16, line 19 – p. 17, line 8, p. 18, line 8 – p. 19, line 17;\nP-1716: T-148, p. 24, lines 4-14; P-1716 Statement, CAR-OTP-2053-0062-R05, at 0067, para. 31). The Chamber has\nconsidered that P-1811 and P-0967 did not seem familiar with ‘[REDACTED]’ and had little to no evidence\nconcerning his presence in the group and his subsequent release. It also appears that both witnesses appeared to confuse\nhim with P-1716. The Chamber recalls that P-0967 said that it was only later, after having read the Letter, she realised\nthat P-1716 stayed with the group that was taken to Yamwara.

Having assessed the evidence holistically, the Chamber finds that P-1704’s\naccount is not reliable in relation to the two aspects mentioned and therefore, does not rely\non it.\nFollowing the men’s interrogation, the elements in Mr Yekatom’s group forced them to\nundress, searched them again, threatened them with death, and found no weapons on any of\nthem.

Elements in Mr Yekatom’s group specifically beat\nSaint Cyr’s legs, breaking them, and tied him up in ‘arbatacher’ manner, continuing to\nassault him. An element in Mr Yekatom’s group, cut off Saint Cyr’s toes, fingers, and an ear,\nbeing encouraged by Cœur de Lion’s presence at the scene and his words, and feeling that\nthere was no choice but to do it. P-1704, P-1705, and P-1716 were present when\nMr Yekatom’s elements interrogated and beat Saint Cyr and cut off his toes, fingers, and an\near.

It argues, inter\nalia, that ‘there is no credible evidence supporting the proposed alibi’ (see Prosecution Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-\n01/18-2738-Conf, paras 694-697 referring to Defence Notification Pursuant to Rule 79 of the Rules of Procedure and\nEvidence, ICC-01/14-01/18-818-Conf (the ‘Rule 79 Notification’), para. 11). The Chamber notes that, in its Closing\nBrief, the Yekatom Defence does not formally raise an alibi in defence. It submits that Mr Yekatom was not at\nYamwara when the seven persons were brought there and only arrived in the evening ‘after Saint-Cyr Lapo’s abuse’.\nHowever, it does claim that Mr Yekatom was ‘about an hour away by foot’ from Yamwara on the afternoon of the\nYamwara Incident and did not return until late that evening, as it did in Rule 79 Notification (see Yekatom Defence\nClosing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2737-Corr-Red, paras 445-446, 452-453).

In respect of the date of this phone call and the Yamwara Incident, the Prosecution\nargues that P-0954 believing that this call took place before 20 December 2013 and therefore, placing it before the\nYamwara Incident, is of ‘minor’ consequence and does not undermine his reliability as he recalled these events 8\nyears after the fact (see Prosecution Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2738-Conf, para. 674). In the view of the\nChamber, P-0954 not remembering the date of this phone call years after the fact does not mean that this phone call\nnever took place.

During their captivity inside Cœur de Lion’s house,\nelements from Mr Yekatom’s group were going in and out of the house and threatened them\nwith death. Mr Yekatom met the female captives inside Cœur de Lion’s house later that\nevening and introduced himself as ‘Rombhot’ and ‘the chief’. Mr Yekatom interrogated the\nfemale captives about their ethnicities and family background. Mr Yekatom knew that the\nthree women were Muslim.

The female captives had no indication about, or reason to\nbelieve, the genuineness of Mr Yekatom’s composure or the purported efforts to have them\nreleased, nor the possibility that they would be released. Mr Yekatom knew that his elements\nhad captured, mistreated, and kept them at gunpoint at Yamwara.\nThe evidence shows that the elements in Mr Yekatom’s group searched the female captives\nagain, removing their veils, and brought them inside Cœur de Lion’s house at gunpoint.

Having assessed Mr Yekatom’s words that P-0967 and P-1811 both\nrecalled, the evidence shows that the female captives had no indication about, or reason to\nbelieve, the genuineness of Mr Yekatom’s composure or purported efforts to have them\nreleased, or the possibility that they would be released.

P-1705 recalled that when this exchange was taking\nplace between P-1654 and Mr Yekatom, Saint Cyr was still in the place where he had been\nmistreated, on the ground (‘au sol’) close to Cœur de Lion’s house; and everyone else was\nin the same position seated on the ground.7969 P-1705 said that he was not in a position to\nconfirm whether Saint Cyr may have been alive when Mr Yekatom arrived at the scene and\nhe did not recall Mr Yekatom saying anything to Saint Cyr or about him to P-1654.7970 P-\n1705 was not certain whether Mr Yekatom saw Saint Cyr or whether P-1654 talked to Saint\nCyr at this time.7971\nAt the same time, this portion of P-1705’s testimony is contrary to him later suggesting that\nthe first time Mr Yekatom spoke to him was only later at the M’Poko airport base.7972\nSimilarly, P-1716 recalled seeing P-1654 but did not recall whether this happened in the\nevening or the morning after and he also did not recall whether there were any exchanges\nbetween P-1654 and Cœur de Lion.7973\nHaving regard to this and the Yekatom Defence arguments, the Chamber has not relied on\nP-1705 to enter conclusions on P-1654’s encounter with Mr Yekatom.\nBased on P-1654’s questioning on his arrival at Yamwara, the Chamber finds that\nMr Yekatom knew of Saint Cyr’s presence at Yamwara at the time of this encounter and the\nfact that some of the captives were Goula or otherwise related to Mamour.

The Chamber further\nnotes that the allegations in the preceding paragraph contrast with abundant evidence\nindicating that the freedom of movement of Muslims on the PK9-Mbaïki was limited at the\ntime. The Chamber will discuss this evidence further below.8111\nThe Chamber notes that not all of the elements based at Yamwara followed Mr Yekatom’s\ngroup in their advance towards Mbaïki.

In particular, Stéphane Chrisostome Dawili stated that around\n4, 5 or 6 January 2014, they (‘we’) left ‘the school’ and ‘attacked’ PK9, Sekia and Ndangala,\nwithout finding any resistance from the Seleka from Sekia all the way to PK9.8120 Moreover,\nin video footages Rodrigue Momokama and Mr Yekatom himself seem to indicate that there\nwere elements at PK9 when Mr Yekatom’s group was still based in Yamwara.8121\nFurther, the Chamber notes that Gérard Ouambou explained that the video footage he\nrecorded shows Anti-Balaka on the other side of the PK9 bridge on 10 January 2014,8122 that\nis, at a time when Mr Yekatom’s elements were about to leave Yamwara.8123 This supports\nthe evidence above which indicates that some of Mr Yekatom’s elements were deployed to\nPK9 already before the majority of the group left the base at Yamwara and embarked on its\nadvance from Bangui down the axis towards Mbaïki.\nThe evidence indicates that Seleka elements were present at PK9 by that time.

As discussed in detail further down, the Chamber is of the\nview that the Seleka retreated due to the advance of Mr Yekatom’s group along the axis,\nwhich also caused the Muslim population of the area to flee first to Mbaïki and eventually\nto Chad and other locations of the CAR.8171\n2.

The Chamber notes that later during her testimony, P-1839 was asked\nabout the following part of her previous statement, related to some lists of elements that the Prosecution investigators\nhad shown to her: ‘I see some names here. These are the names of people who had nothing to do with us ever since\nYamwara. Because I can see that he included the names of family members, and these people had nothing to do with\nthe Anti-Balaka. And I even entered some names. And, honestly, there weren’t a lot of us. There weren’t thousands\nof us, actually. But when we were on the Mbaïki road, from PK9 to Mbaïki, I was given a number of names. These\nare names of family members, friends, acquaintances to add to the list so as to benefit from the DDR money’. P-1839\nwas specifically asked whether she could confirm that that is what she said in 2020 about the lists when she was\nquestioned by the Prosecution investigators, and P-1839 confirmed it (see P-1839: T-174, p. 37, line 15 – p. 38, line\n15). Following this exchange, P-1839 was asked about specific names included in several lists (see P-1839: T-174, p.\n38, line 17 – p. 44, line 20). The Chamber understood the above as P-1839 being asked to confirm her previous\nstatement according to which not all of the names appearing on the lists would have been Anti-Balaka members –\nwhich she confirmed –, and is of the view that this is how P-1839 understood the question as well. Therefore, for the\nnumber of Anti-Balaka elements on the Mbaïki road, the Chamber will consider the evidence P-1839 provided when\ndirectly and specifically asked about it during her testimony (in particular, when P-1839 was asked ‘do you recall how\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 1115/1616 24 July 2025",

The Chamber notes that the metadata of the video is not available. At the same time, it notes that\nin one of the clips included in the video, the journalist indicates that the gendarmes have no choice but to work with\nthe Anti-Balaka despite having been designated enemies of the peace at the beginning of February by Catherine\nSamba-Panza, the new Central African president. The journalist also mentions that Rombhot and his men settled ‘ici’,\nreferring to PK9, in the peak of the crisis, six weeks ago (see Video, CAR-OTP-2055-2610, at approximately 00:02:12-\n00:03:02; Translation, CAR-OTP-2122-2271, at 2276, lines 80-95). The Chamber is therefore of the view that while\nit cannot determine the exact date of the video, it is reasonable to infer that parts of the footage were taken in mid- to\nend of February 2014. See also P-0801: T-035, p. 69, line 23 – p. 73, line 25 (confirming that he recognised Mr\nYekatom in the video footage, and indicating that the encounter with Mr Yekatom took place towards the south side\nof the PK9 bridge and that it occurred before he assumed his duties with the prime minister). In this regard, the\nChamber notes that P-0801 was appointed special advisor in charge of the disarmament process on 27 February 2014\n(see Decree, CAR-OTP-2004-1180, at 1217).\n8176 P-0954 Statement, CAR-OTP-2048-0171-R03, at 0185, para. 80; P-0954: T-166, p. 43, lines 16-20. See also p.\n60, lines 19-23. The Chamber notes the Yekatom Defence’s assertion that during his testimony, P-0954 was shown\nthe video in which Mr Yekatom refers to having 3,000 men and ‘confirm[ed] this figure while providing no further\nbasis for this assertion, instead, referring to his initial statement’, in which P-0954 indicated that ‘[REDACTED]’.\nThe Yekatom Defence contends that P-0954’s claim in this regard ‘is based on no more than propaganda’ (Yekatom\nDefence Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2737-Conf-Corr, para. 267). The Chamber, however, notes that the Yekatom\nDefence disregards the fact that P-0954 was first asked whether he knew how many elements or men were under\nMr Yekatom’s control in his group at the time they were in PK9, to which he responded that ‘at that point of time, he\nhad almost […] he had around a hundred or some FACA and 3,000 civilian Anti-Balaka’ (see P-0954: T-166, p. 43,\nlines 16-20). It further notes that only later, after being showed the abovementioned video, P-0954 was asked to\nconfirm whether to his recollection or knowledge at the time, Mr Yekatom had 3,000 elements, which he confirmed,\nindicating that he even mentioned it in his written statement (see P-0954: T-166, p. 60, lines 19-23). Further,\nconsidering that P-0954’s indication that Mr Yekatom had 3,000 men under his command accords with what Mr\nYekatom himself, as well as other individuals, said, the Chamber does not consider his evidence on this point to be\npurely based on ‘propaganda’.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 1116/1616 24 July 2025",

In the Chamber’s view, this can give an approximate indication of Mr\nYekatom’s group’s dimension.\nIn particular, video footage shows Rodrigue Momokama telling a journalist, at a time before\nDjotodia’s resignation, that they had to deploy almost 100 elements to PK9, towards the\nother road leading to Mbaïki.8177 Stéphane Chrisostome Dawili testified that there were\n‘[d]ozens’ of elements ‘per post’ and indicated that in Kapou or PK9 there could have been\n20, 25 or several hundreds of elements.8178 In fact, Stéphane Chrisostome Dawili stated that\nwhen he became deputy ComZone of Mbaïki, he and the ComZone had around 80 to 90\npeople under their command.8179 He later testified that as deputy ComZone of Mbaïki, he\nand the ComZone Sete had about 40 elements under their control in Mbaïki.8180 In this\nregard, the Chamber notes the conclusion it reaches further down on the number of elements\nunder Mr Yekatom’s command who were in Mbaïki at the time. In particular, it notes that\nhaving considered the evidence of several witnesses, including that of Stéphane Chrisostome\nDawili, the Chamber concludes that Mr Yekatom and the elements who arrived with him to\nMbaïki on 30 January 2014 amounted to at least 25 individuals; and that the total number of\nelements in Mbaïki in the following days amounted to at least 80 individuals.8181\nBy contrast, Vivien Beina testified that when he asked Mr Yekatom about telling some\nNGOs that he had 3,000 men as recorded in the video mentioned above, Mr Yekatom said\nto him that it was ‘strategic’, to impress ‘the enemy’.8182 The witness was unable to provide\nan estimation but testified that ‘the number was less than 3,000’.8183 Vivien Beina also\ntestified, when shown a list of elements, that some people were included in these lists even\n8177 Video, CAR-OTP-2065-3412, at approximately 00:00:27-00:00:36; Translation, CAR-OTP-2125-0470, at 0472,\nlines 17-18.

Indeed, taking Mr Yekatom’s affirmation on his own group’s size together with the\nfact that Vivien Beina was unable to provide any estimate of the group’s size, merely stating\nthat it was ‘less than’ 3,000, is insufficient to lead the Chamber to any conclusion in this\nregard. Rather, and bearing in mind the other evidence before it, set out above, including\nfrom individuals who were in a position to make informed estimates, the Chamber concludes\nthat Mr Yekatom’s group along the PK9-Mbaïki axis comprised at least 1,000 elements.\nFurthermore, the Chamber notes that when asked whether after Djotodia’s resignation there\nwere elements who said that they were Anti-Balaka but were not part of Mr Yekatom’s group\nin Lobaye, Vivien Beina agreed and indicated that ‘there were subgroups, armed groups that\nwere non-identified who came from the bush or from the forest to carry out exactions’, and\nthat it was ‘very frequent’.8186 The Chamber, however, notes that it reached its above\nconclusion taking into account the evidence mostly provided by Anti-Balaka elements,\nincluding members close to Mr Yekatom and his group, whom it would expect to be able to\ndiscern between members of their own movement and unidentified armed groups coming\nfrom the bush or the forest to commit exactions.

P-0888 also explained that Mr Yekatom said\nthat since they had stolen, refused to admit it, wanted to challenge him, and since they were all soldiers, they would\n‘have to put an end to this matter’; thereafter, Mr Yekatom, Habib Beina and the group arrived in PK9 by foot,\nanticipating that ‘they’ waited for a vehicle, and Mr Yekatom shot at the three elements, which P-0888 described as\n‘almost a duel’ (see P-0888: T-120, p. 49, lines 9-25). When the Presiding Judge asked whether it would be fair to say\nthat there had been an exchange of bullets between two groups, P-0888 clarified that they all belonged to ‘the same\ngroup of Rambo’ and that since they were soldiers, they always had their weapons with them (see P-0888: T-120,\np. 50, line 10 – p. 51, line 13). The Chamber is therefore of the view that neither P-0888 nor the Presiding Judge\ndescribed or understood the incident to be the result of a duel between two parties, contrary to the Yekatom Defence’s\nsuggestions.

In the Chamber’s view, incidents such as this\none served Mr Yekatom to assert his power within the group and send a message to the rest\nof the elements.8208\nSeveral other witnesses gave evidence about Mr Yekatom’s incontestable leadership over\nthe elements deployed on the PK9-Mbaïki axis.\nBrice Emotion Namsio, the former spokesperson of the Anti-Balaka, indicated that Mr\nYekatom was the commander of the Anti-Balaka ‘of the south’ and the person who\ncontrolled Lobaye.8209\nLikewise, P-0884, [REDACTED] testified that Mr Yekatom controlled the road all the way\nto Mbaïki.8210 Another Anti-Balaka member, P-2232, [REDACTED] testified that\nMr Yekatom, ‘Rambo’, controlled the Mbaïki area and coordinated the operations in that\nsector.8211\nFurther, the Chamber notes that when talking to a journalist, Mr Yekatom introduced himself\nas ‘caporal-chef Yekatom Rambo Alfred, chef of the Anti-Balaka movement of the south’,\nthem with some of his men, he carried an AK47 in firing position and shot at them (see P-1647 Statement, CAR-OTP-\n2050-0654-R02, at 0662, para. 53).\n8208 See e.g. P-1786 Statement, CAR-OTP-2058-0200-R03, at 0209, paras 49-52.

The Chamber considers, however, that the accounts of these witnesses\nsupport fundamental aspects of the accounts of both P-1647 and P-0888 (see e.g. P-1839: T-171, p. 79, lines 2-23,\nwho stated that ‘Rombhot’ fatally shot Seda and another person of the group; P-1786 Statement, CAR-OTP-2058-\n0200-R03, at 0209, para. 52, [REDACTED]; P-0954, CAR-OTP-2048-0171-R03, at 0186, para. 87, who indicated\nthat Mr Yekatom killed three persons – Seda, Fadal and a ‘third Aide de Camp’), [REDACTED].

In\nthe view of the Chamber, in its factual analysis one cannot be divided from the other.\nContrarily to the Yekatom Defence’s position, the Chamber considers highly relevant that\nthe elements of Mr Yekatom’s group consistently testified to Cœur de Lion being the\n‘deputy’.

In both formal and informal\nsense, military or civilian, it conveys the same and unambiguous directional flow of\nauthority.\nIn relation to the Yekatom Defence’s submissions concerning P-1786, the Chamber notes\nthat P-1786 stated that despite the fact that Cœur de Lion was Mr Yekatom’s deputy, they\ndid not always get along; Cœur de Lion kept his distance from Mr Yekatom, he did not like\nthat Mr Yekatom did not fight in the front lines with them and thought that he kept money\nfrom the Seleka.8227 P-1786 also stated that Mr Yekatom was close to Momokama and Habib\nBeina.8228 The Chamber is of the view that the fact that Mr Yekatom had a smoother or close\npersonal relationship with other elements of his group does not detract from the fact that\nCœur de Lion was under Mr Yekatom’s command.\nP-1839 and Vivien Beina indicated that Habib Beina replaced Cœur de Lion as\nMr Yekatom’s deputy after his death.8229 Stéphane Chrisostome Dawili confirmed this,\nstating that after Cœur de Lion had died in combat in Boda (shortly after taking over\nMbaïki),8230 Mr Yekatom appointed Habib Beina as his new deputy.8231 P-0954 stated that\nHabib Beina attended a meeting as the deputy of Mr Yekatom around August 2014, months\nafter Cœur de Lion’s death.8232\n3.

In the words of the former general director of the gendarmerie in the context\nof the encounter at the PK9 bridge,8310 whatever happened after crossing the PK9 barrier was\nunder the Anti-Balaka’s competence. It further notes that while these authorities were\nallowed to go back to the PK9 and Sekia checkpoints, they did so alongside Anti-Balaka\nelements posted there, who were mostly armed FACA members dressed in military\nuniform.8311 The Chamber considers that there is a nuanced but relevant difference between\nallowing the authorities to be physically present in their duty stations and handing them over\neffective responsibility for the checkpoints, as argued by the Yekatom Defence.8312 It is also\nthe Chamber’s view that this does not equate to the Anti-Balaka leaving all checkpoints, as\nRoger Okoa-Penguia described.\nSpecifically with regard to Guerrino Perin’s evidence above, the Chamber notes that the\nwitness’s source of information is unclear and that it contradicts Raymond Mongbandi’s\nevidence, who testified that he did not hear that MISCA had asked Mr Yekatom to patrol the\nregions to re-establish public order.8313 The Chamber, recalling the witness’s unique position\nas Mbaïki’s mayor at the time, considers his evidence more reliable on this point.\nThe Yekatom Defence further argues that the objective of the presence of the ‘RFACPP’ in\nthe checkpoints was ‘to free the Bimbo road so that the population could circulate freely’.8314\nIn line with this argument, Vivien Beina testified that at a certain point in time, Mr Yekatom\nmade clear that Muslims could continue their activities on the PK9-Mbaïki axis without any\nproblems. In particular, the witness explained that a young Muslim who lived in Kilometre\n5 falsified his ID card to move around and find food.8315 The Anti-Balaka identified him as\na Muslim but Mr Yekatom allowed him to circulate freely on the axis.8316 According to\n8310 See footnote 8175 above.\n8311 See e.g. P-2084 Statement, CAR-OTP-2094-0968-R02, at 0984, para. 79.\n8312 Yekatom Defence Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2737-Corr-Red, para. 483.\n8313 P-1838: T-216, p. 27, lines 9-12.\n8314 Yekatom Defence Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2737-Corr-Red, para. 483.\n8315 P-0888: T-122, p. 19, line 4 – p. 21, line 21.\n8316 P-0888: T-122, p. 19, line 4 – p. 21, line 21.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 1134/1616 24 July 2025",

On the contrary, the Chamber is convinced that Mr Yekatom instrumentalised the\ncheckpoints in the villages along the axis to search and identify Muslims.

The Chamber also notes that in any event, his\ndescription accords with the other evidence outlined above.\nSignificantly, P-1962 stated that Mr Yekatom’s deputy, Cœur de Lion, had chased away the\nMuslims from PK9 to Mbaïki and along the road to Boda, that he wanted to chase out the\nMuslims that were still left in Boda, and that he did not hide the fact that he wanted to chase\nthe Muslims out of the CAR and to their ‘country of origin’.8362\nMoreover, the evidence also shows that the Anti-Balaka used the checkpoints on the PK9-\nMbaïki axis to raise money to finance the group and its needs.\nIn this context, the Chamber notes P-1839’s description of the role and activities of the\ntreasurer of Mr Yekatom’s group during this time.

The Chamber further notes that in fact, P-2419 had to find a\nsafer hiding place, the bush, upon the Anti-Balaka’s arrival in Bimon; and after hearing that\nthey were looking for Muslims, he fled to Bangui, disguising himself as a non-Muslim.

Further noting that the\nMuslim population in Mbaïki by the end of 2012 amounted to at least 2,000 individuals,8471\nthe Chamber considers that it can reasonably conclude, based on the evidence above, that at\nleast 1,000 Muslim civilians fled to Mbaïki.8472\nSeveral witnesses described the living conditions of the Muslim community in Mbaïki as\nbeing very difficult at the time.8473\n8470 P-1666: T-231, p. 24, line 19 – p. 25, line 4.\n8471 To make this calculation, the Chamber took into account the following information. First, P-1813, who was the\nprefect of the Lobaye prefecture residing in Mbaïki at the relevant time, stated that the population in Mbaïki by the\nend of 2012 approximately ranged between 22,000 to 25,000 and that ‘about 1 out of every 10 individuals was a\nMuslim’ (see P-1813 First Statement, CAR-OTP-2069-0035-R02, at 0038, para. 21). Second, Antareze-De-Neve\nMadongagba testified that Muslims represented between 12 and 15 per cent of the population of Mbaïki in 2013 (see\nD29-5012: T-293, p. 11, lines 21-22).\n8472 See also Press Article, CAR-OTP-2117-0687, at 0687 (indicating that on 6 February, more than 2,500 Muslims\nof Mbaïki embarked on Chadian military trucks to be ‘evacuated’); Press Article, CAR-OTP-2001-4422, at 4422\n(referring to the fact that between 4 and 12 February 2014, thousands of Muslims chased out of their villages and\nsheltered in Mbaïki, left the town). The Chamber notes the Ngaïssona Defence’s observations regarding reliability\nand authenticity of CAR-OTP-2117-0687 (see Annex A to Defence Response to “Prosecution’s Fifteenth submission\nof miscellaneous items of evidence via the “bar table”” ICC-01/14-01/18-2058, 7 September 2023, ICC-01/14-01/18-\n2084-Conf-AnxA, pp. 20-22, 24). In the view of the Chamber, its use of this item is limited to underscore its finding\nbased on other evidence available. While the information from the article as such has not been verified with the author,\nit was considered merely in the context of additional evidence. Furthermore, while the URL may not be entirely visible\nto thereby verify the information, the Chamber notes that according to the JEM code, as well as the submission of the\nProsecution (see Annex to Prosecution’s Fifteenth submission of miscellaneous items of evidence via the “bar table”,\n25 August 2023, ICC-01/14-01/18-2058-Conf-Anx, p. 15), the document was provided by an individual who used to\nbe on the Prosecution’s witness list, and who appears to be the author of this article. The Chamber also notes the\nYekatom Defence’s opposition to the submission of CAR-OTP-2001-4422 on the basis of prejudice outweighing its\nprobative value (see Annex A to Yekatom Defence Response to ‘Prosecution’s Eleventh Application for the\nSubmission of Open-source Evidence from the Bar Table’, 21 August 2023, ICC-01/14-01/18-2037-Conf-AnxA, pp.\n11-12). In this regard, the Chamber notes that the Yekatom Defence’s arguments mainly concerned the content of this\narticle in relation to the killing of Djido Saleh. As in the current context, the Chamber merely considered the\ninformation regarding the situation in Mbaïki in the context of other information, and the Chamber is of the view that\nno prejudice arises in this regard.\n8473 P-1838 Statement, CAR-OTP-2100-0252-R05, at 0263-64, para. 61; P-2041 Statement, CAR-OTP-2104-0003-\nR02, at 0010-11, para. 48; P-2041: T-229, p. 81, line 24 – p. 82, line 9; P-2353 Statement, CAR-OTP-2100-0226-\nR03, at 0234, para. 46; P-2353: T-161, p. 22, line 20 – p. 23, line 24; P-2354 Statement, CAR-OTP-2105-0991-R03,\nat 0999-1000, para. 46.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 1155/1616 24 July 2025",

The evidence\nby Alexandre Kouroupe-Awo and Antareze-De-Neve Madongagba is clear on their meeting\nwith Mr Yekatom in Pissa to arrange a meeting with the Seleka still present in Mbaïki. That\nD29-5013 [REDACTED] which then included further international stakeholders does not\ndistract from this evidence.

While Alexandre Kouroupe-Awo described hearing from Seleka elements\nthat Mr Yekatom had reached out to them and told them to leave Mbaïki, as discussed above,\nand Guerrino Perin suggested that there was good will between ‘the Seleka, Adam’ and Mr\nYekatom to avoid inter-communal violence,8518 the evidence available does not indicate that\n8515 [REDACTED]\n8516 P-1813 First Statement, CAR-OTP-2069-0035-R02, at 0042-43, para. 49 (stating that at midnight of the day before\nthey were supposed to hold the meeting, the Seleka called him to say they were leaving Mbaïki); D29-5012: T-293,\np. 41, lines 12-18, p. 45, line 15 – p. 46, line 6 (indicating that the Seleka left Mbaïki one night, before 30 January\n2014); D29-5015: T-254, p. 36, lines 10-24, p. 42, lines 6-20; T-255, p. 38, line 20 – p. 39, line 5 (testifying that the\nSeleka were supposed to attend the meeting but ‘the day before [they] were supposed to have a meeting, they left’).\nThe Chamber notes in this regard that (i) P-1813 testified that one night the Seleka called him to say that they were\nleaving and moving to another place following their superior’s instructions; (ii) Guerrino Perin testified that Colonel\nAnour called his deputy ‘Abbot Antarese’ and informed him that the Seleka were leaving; and (iii) Antareze-De-Neve\nMadongagba testified that they learned the Seleka left one night because two or three Central African Seleka elements\nwho refused to leave sought refuge at the cathedral the same night.

The fact remains that the Seleka left\nMbaïki on the night of 29 January 2014. The Chamber further notes the evidence of P-2353, who, while stating that\nthe Seleka left ‘shortly’ after Michel Djotodia had resigned, also said that the Seleka left at night, without warning,\nand that the Anti-Balaka arrived the next morning (see P-2353 Statement, CAR-OTP-2100-0226-R03, at 0234, para.\n47).

He responded that he did not remember and that, in fact, he did\nnot hear Guerrino Perin ‘addressing the meeting and warning anyone at all’.8611\nThe Chamber is mindful that no other witnesses mentioned Guerrino Perin’s warning to\nMr Yekatom, as well as of the evidence of Guerrino Perin and Antareze-De-Neve\nMadongagba on this point as outlined above. Nonetheless, the Chamber considers P-2041’s\ntestimony reliable on this aspect, and notes that his evidence is supported by the Notes taken\ncontemporaneously during the meeting in question. Accordingly, the Chamber relies on his\nevidence regarding Guerrino Perin’s warning to Mr Yekatom in the terms described.\nAccording to Alexandre Kouroupe-Awo and D29-5013, they both asked Mr Yekatom to\nprotect the Muslim population. In particular, Alexandre Kouroupe-Awo indicated that he felt\nthat there was a high risk that the Anti-Balaka would attack the Muslim population and\ntherefore asked Mr Yekatom to ensure the Muslim population that they would not be\nharmed.8612 Likewise, D29-5013 testified that she asked Mr Yekatom to make his elements\navailable to protect the Muslims in Mbaïki before their departure, and that Mr Yekatom\naccepted her request by designating Cœur de Lion for this task.8613\nIn this regard, the Chamber notes that several witnesses indicated that the removal of\nMuslims from Mbaïki was decided at the meeting. Their evidence, as well as the evidence\noutlined further below,8614 shows that at this point, their removal from Mbaïki was a foregone\nconclusion. Notably, Alexandre Kouroupe-Awo stated that one of the issues they discussed\nat the meeting was ‘the movement of the Chadian Muslim community’.8615 He later clearly\nindicated that the decision to take them out of Mbaïki ‘was taken and discussed during the\n8611 D29-5012: T-294, p. 13, line 16 – p. 14, line 16.\n8612 P-1813 First Statement, CAR-OTP-2069-0035-R02, at 0043, para. 54.

In particular, Alexandre Kouroupe-Awo stated that the Chadian Muslim\ncommunity in Mbaïki felt threatened and prior to the Anti-Balaka’s arrival in Mbaïki spoke\nwith the Chadian authorities ‘to see if there was a way they could be evacuated’.8622\nAlexandre Kouroupe-Awo also stated that prior to the Mbaïki meeting, the representatives\nof the Malian Muslim community also told him that they would leave with the Chadian\nMuslims if the latter were being ‘evacuated’.8623 Moreover, a witness testified that in the\ncontext of the preparations of the meeting, an individual involved in these preparations went\nto see Mr Yekatom ‘to negotiate’ and ask him whether he could agree ‘to some kind of\nsolution for the Muslims in Mbaïki’, further indicating that this individual was successful in\ntheir mission, namely, ‘to ensure the release of the Muslims’.8624 In the Chamber’s view, this\nshows that [REDACTED] discussed with Mr Yekatom the possibility of moving Muslims\nout of Mbaïki before the meeting.

The Anti-Balaka also attacked a gendarme patrol in Mbaïki which was there to protect\nthe population, taking the patrol’s weapons and the service car that they were using.\nThe Chamber heard numerous witnesses who described the threats made to the Muslims in\nMbaïki, and the harassment they were subjected to, following the arrival of Mr Yekatom’s\ngroup in the town.\nSome of these witnesses claimed that those who threatened and harassed Muslims were\nmostly the local youngsters of Mbaïki, who saw in the Anti-Balaka an opportunity to take\nrevenge for the abuses committed by the Seleka, considered the ‘protectors’ of Muslims.\nThese witnesses seemed to draw a clear line between the Anti-Balaka elements that arrived\nin Mbaïki and the local youngsters who were not officially part of the group, and who\noutnumbered the Anti-Balaka elements, according to their evidence.\nThis is the case of Alexandre Kouroupe-Awo, who explained that after the abuses committed\nby the Seleka, deemed ‘the protectors of the Muslims’, and following their departure from\nMbaïki and the arrival of the Anti-Balaka, the ‘indigenous population’ were up in arms\nagainst the Chadian community.8709 They assumed that the Anti-Balaka would enable them\n‘to wreak revenge upon the Muslim population because their protectors were no longer\nthere’.8710 Alexandre Kouroupe-Awo explained that ‘independently of the Anti-Balaka’,\nmany individuals ‘amongst the indigenous population’ wanted to attack the Muslims and\nloot their possessions.8711 The witness stated that ‘a lot of young people were interested in\n8708 D29-5013: T-285, p. 45, lines 6-9.\n8709 P-1813: T-180, p. 18, lines 8-25, p. 22, lines 5-21.\n8710 P-1813: T-180, p. 22, lines 5-21.\n8711 P-1813: T-180, p. 27, line 9 – p. 28, line 18.

The evidence outlined above can only be assessed considering\nthis context. This is the case of the identification and disarming of ‘fake Anti-Balaka’.\nIndeed, the Chamber observes that the event in which Mr Yekatom disarmed ‘fake Anti-\nBalaka’ took place in April 2014, that is, more than one month after the Muslims were\nremoved from Mbaïki. Also the other evidence discussed above suggests that events such as\nthe handing over of weapons, or Stéphane Chrisostome Dawili being tasked with identifying\n‘fake Anti-Balaka’ in Mbaïki, took place after the Muslim civilian population was removed\nfrom Mbaïki.8775 In relation to Stéphane Chrisostome Dawili’s task, the Chamber in any\nevent notes that it did not hear any concrete evidence on specific measures taken by the\nwitness in Mbaïki to fulfill his duty to identify ‘fake Anti-Balaka’.\nMoreover, the Chamber notes that despite the meetings Mr Yekatom attended, Raymond\nMongbandi indicated that Mr Yekatom did not cooperate with MISCA/MINUSCA to ensure\nsecurity in Mbaïki.

The violence the Anti-Balaka exerted on Muslim civilians did\nnot end as a consequence of the measures Mr Yekatom implemented but because the\nMuslims were removed from Mbaïki and transported elsewhere.\nIn addition to the above, Alexandre Kouroupe-Awo stated that he gave the gendarmerie in\nMbaïki his own ‘service car’ so that they could patrol the area at night to protect the local\npopulation, and that one night a group of Anti-Balaka attacked them while patrolling, taking\ntheir weapons and the ‘service car’.8778 Similarly, P-2041 stated that approximately four days\nafter the Anti-Balaka arrived in Mbaïki, they took the vehicle of the gendarmerie company\ncommander and drove towards Bangui.8779\n6. Dislocation of Muslims from Mbaïki\nOn 6 February 2014, Chadian forces transported a first group of Muslim civilians from\nMbaïki to Chad and other locations in the CAR. These Muslim civilians had to leave their\nbelongings behind. They left Mbaïki in fear of the Anti-Balaka and, in particular, due to the\narrival of Mr Yekatom’s group to Mbaïki. The total number of Muslims removed from\nMbaïki at the time amounted to at least 3,000. As a result of this dislocation, very few Muslim\ncivilians remained in Mbaïki. The living conditions in the refugee camps in Chad were\nextremely difficult.\nOn 6 February 2014, Chadian forces arrived in Mbaïki to transport the Muslim population\nout of Mbaïki.8780 Their dislocation was caused by the arrival of Mr Yekatom’s group to\nMbaïki after advancing along the axis and had been decided at the meeting of 30 January\n2014.8781 The affected individuals included inhabitants of Mbaïki as well as inhabitants of\n8778 P-1813 First Statement, CAR-OTP-2069-0035-R02, at 0044, para. 58.

Yet, D29-5013 also indicated that ‘young people’ in Mbaïki\nwanted to fight the Muslims and the Christian population made comments such as ‘they have\nto leave’.8880\nStéphane Chrisostome Dawili claimed that the Anti-Balaka cohabited with the Muslims in\nMbaïki ‘without any problems’ but that they were scared ‘just because of [their] presence’\nand asked to be ‘evacuated’.8881\nThe Chamber, however, considers that there is overwhelming evidence, set out above, which\ndemonstrates that Muslims fled Mbaïki because they were afraid of the Anti-Balaka. These\nfears were not unfounded or based on the mere presence of the Anti-Balaka in the town. In\nthis regard, the Chamber recalls its findings above that elements belonging to Mr Yekatom’s\ngroup, as well as local youngsters, threatened and harassed the Muslim civilian population\nof Mbaïki – the former as soon as they arrived in the town.8882 From that moment onwards,\nMuslims in Mbaïki were not able to move around freely and their living conditions worsened\nby the day. As described by various witnesses, Muslims felt that they had no choice but to\nleave Mbaïki as they believed that the Anti-Balaka would kill them if they stayed any longer.\nAccordingly, the Chamber puts no weight on the claims that Muslims left Mbaïki because\nan ‘evacuation’ had been arranged in advance, or because Muslims ‘wanted’ to leave\nregardless of the Anti-Balaka. The Chamber reiterates that even if Muslims agreed or\nrequested to be removed from Mbaïki, they did so because they felt that their lives were in\ndanger as long as they stayed in Mbaïki. In the Chamber’s view, this reflects that there was\na genuine lack of choice on their part.\nThereafter, the Congolese MISCA transported a second group of Muslims out of Mbaïki to\nBangui and other locations.\nSeveral witnesses indicated that after the Chadian forces transported the first group of\nMuslims out of Mbaïki, the Congolese MISCA arrived in Mbaïki and transported a second\ngroup of Muslims out of the town.\n8880 D29-5013: T-285, p. 31, lines 16-23.\n8881 P-1647 Statement, CAR-OTP-2050-0654-R02, at 0661, para. 48.\n8882 See paragraphs 3533-3551 above.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 1208/1616 24 July 2025",

It appears\nthat the ‘Mission internationale de soutien à la Centrafrique sous conduite africaine’ (MISCA) started replacing the\npreviously deployed assistance in July 2013, whereas the ‘Mission multidimensionnelle intégrée de stabilisation des\nNations unies un République centrafricaine’ (MINUSCA) started operating in September 2014 (see Resolution\nS/RES/2149 (2014), CAR-OTP-2001-1043, at 1049-50, paras 18-20; UN SG Report, CAR-OTP-2001-1057, at 1057,\npara. 1; Press article, CAR-D29-0002-0690, at 0692-93). Given the deployment of various international or\ninternationalised forces in the CAR over prolonged periods, the Chamber considers this confusion of terms to be\nunderstandable and will refer to the acronyms as they were used in witnesses’ testimonies, with the understanding that\nthis may not necessarily accurately refer to the force in fact operating at the respective time.\n8932 P-1838: T-215, p. 22, line 16 – p. 23, line 15.

In particular, Alexandre Kouroupe-Awo stated that it\nwas known that Saleh ‘had dealings with the Seleka and would give his vehicle for them to\nuse’, and that he heard that he was part of a group of Seleka from Mbaïki that went to Bangui-\nBouchia after the killings there ‘to wreak revenge’.8941 Raymond Mongbandi indicated that\nwhen the Seleka were in Mbaïki, they forced Saleh to use his vehicle to move possessions\nlooted from the population from Mbaïki to Bangui.8942 He also stated that Saleh took part in\nthe reprisal against Christians in Bangui-Bouchia and that he talked to Saleh about this,\ntelling him that he was ‘a public figure[,] a member of the local administration’ and should\nnot have taken part in ‘such reprisal actions’.8943 Moreover, Raymond Mongbandi mentioned\nan incident which took place after Saleh went to see the Seleka following their arrival in\nPissa in order to mediate, and promised some elements to bring them a sheep.8944 These\nelements considered that it took Saleh too long to bring the sheep and attacked him beating\nhim up ‘very violently’.8945 P-2353 also mentioned an incident in which Saleh was unable to\npay a tax levied by the Seleka and was detained, with his brother paying 200,000 CFA before\nhe was released.8946\nThe Chamber notes that while the above evidence could suggest that Saleh participated in\nthe reprisal acts committed by the Seleka in Bangui-Bouchia, it also indicates that the Seleka\nforced him to collaborate with the group and mistreated him. Accordingly, and on the basis\nof the evidence before it, the Chamber cannot conclude that Saleh was a member of, or\notherwise affiliated with, the Seleka at the time of his death.8947\nIn addition, besides witnesses expressing concern for Saleh’s and his family’s safety, as set\nout above, Raymond Mongbandi provided a detailed account of an incident involving Mr\nYekatom’s elements and Saleh which occurred prior to his killing.

Further, noting Raymond Mongbandi’s detailed\naccount of Saleh’s interrogation by Cœur de Lion, whom according to the evidence\nMr Yekatom appointed as the person in charge of the group in Mbaïki,8956 the Chamber\nconcludes that at least some of these threats were made by elements of Mr Yekatom’s group.\nThere is no indication in the evidence before the Chamber that Anti-Balaka elements\ndemanded money from Saleh.\n8948 P-1838 Statement, CAR-OTP-2100-0252-R05, at 0268, para. 91.\n8949 P-1838 Statement, CAR-OTP-2100-0252-R05, at 0268, para. 91; P-1838: T-215, p. 18, lines 6-22.\n8950 P-1838 Statement, CAR-OTP-2100-0252-R05, at 0268, para. 91.\n8951 P-1838: T-215, p. 18, line 23 – p. 19, line 6, p. 20, lines 1-6. The Chamber notes that Raymond Mongbandi testified\nthat at the time of Saleh’s interrogation, ‘there were no longer any Muslims in Mbaïki’, ‘[t]he trucks had extracted all\nthe Muslims from Mbaïki’, ‘[t]here was only one [Muslim] left’ (see P-1838: T-215, p. 19, lines 3-4). At the same\ntime, it notes that P-2041 and P-1666 indicated that Cœur de Lion was killed in Boda, that they saw his body when it\nwas brought to Mbaïki and that this happened before their evacuation from Mbaïki (see P-2041 Statement, CAR-OTP-\n2104-0003-R02, at 0014, para. 62; P-1666: T-232, p. 6, lines 14-22). The Chamber also notes the Yekatom Defence’s\nargument that ‘P-1838’s uncorroborated claim that Ouandjio had previously “interrogated” Saleh in a “threatening”\nmanner, “because at the time there were no more Muslims in Mbaïki”’ should be disregarded, inter alia, ‘given that\nOuandjio had died prior to the evacuation of the Mbaïki Muslims, thus rendering the very basis of the supposed threat\nlogically and chronologically incoherent’ (see Yekatom Defence Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2737-Corr-Red,\npara. 541, footnotes omitted). However, the Chamber notes that Raymond Mongbandi also indicated that the\ninterrogation took place ‘[s]hortly after the Anti-Balaka arrived [to Mbaïki]’, on the first day he met Cœur de Lion\n(see P-1838 Statement, CAR-OTP-2100-0252-R05, at 0268, para. 91; P-1838: T-215, p. 18, lines 6-22, p. 19, lines 7-\n14), which occurred before Cœur de Lion left Mbaïki for Boda. Thus, considering this and his overall account, the\nChamber considers that Raymond Mongbandi erred when mentioning that there were no longer Muslims in Mbaïki at\nthe time of the interrogation, and finds his account otherwise reliable and credible.\n8952 P-1838: T-215, p. 19, line 15 – p. 20, line 6.\n8953 See paragraph 3633 above.\n8954 See paragraph 3634 above.\n8955 See paragraph 3635 above.\n8956 See paragraph 3528 above.

Djido Saleh’s family fled. As Djido Saleh tried to flee, the group of\nindividuals pursued him and threw stones at him. Djido Saleh tried to defend himself with a\nbow and at least one arrow. The group of individuals, which included at least three elements\nof Mr Yekatom’s group, one of them being Honorine Gbafalo, killed him as he tried to reach\nthe gendarmerie. Honorine Gbafalo cut off his genitals. Other individuals beat him and cut\nparts of his body, including one of his ears and his neck, partly severing his head. These\nindividuals targeted Djido Saleh on the basis that he was a Muslim. Following the death of\nDjido Saleh, Mr Yekatom told Raymond Mongbandi that the killing was ‘an accident’ and\nthat he would pay for the burial, which he never did. As a direct consequence of the killing,\nMISCA ordered Mr Yekatom and his elements to leave Mbaïki, which they immediately did.\nThe Chamber heard the account of several witnesses who described how a number of\nindividuals attacked and killed Saleh, and thereafter mistreated his body by beating him and\ncutting parts of his body, including his genitals, one of his ears and his neck, partly severing\nhis head, as he laid on the ground. The Chamber relied on these accounts, as well as on other\nevidence discussed during the trial, particularly a video footage showing how Saleh’s body\nwas mistreated after his killing,8958 for the findings set out below.\nOn 28 February 2014, a group of individuals attacked Saleh’s house while he and his family\nwere inside.8959 As Saleh tried to flee and reach the gendarmerie to seek shelter, the\n8957 See paragraph 1300 above.\n8958 Video, CAR-OTP-2059-0384.

In the Chamber’s view, the suggestion that there may have been tampering or corruption of the data\nis, without anything further, speculative at best. Furthermore, the Chamber has assessed the video as part of its holistic\nevaluation of all evidence before it, also taking into account the identification of individuals in the video, as well as\nthe fact that it is not disputed that the video does show the mistreatment of Saleh’s body.\n8959 P-1838 Statement, CAR-OTP-2100-0252-R05, at 0270, para. 99, at 0271, para. 102 (stating that he noted down\nin his personal notebook that Saleh’s killing took place on 28 February 2014); P-1813: T-180, p. 31, lines 6-11\n(testifying that Saleh was taken from his domicile before being executed); P-1595 Statement, CAR-OTP-2104-0274-\nR02, at 0293, para. 98 (stating that he was told that Saleh was attacked when he was in his house with all his family);\nP-1595: T-106, p. 14, lines 8-21 (testifying that they attacked Saleh in his compound, in the presence of his wife, who\nwas pregnant at the time, and his children).\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 1219/1616 24 July 2025",

The Chamber notes that a handwritten note which appears to be dated 2 March\n2014 suggests that when a crowd of youth demonstrated, demanding Saleh to leave Mbaïki, the latter injured three\nyouth, which provoked the anger of the youth that then killed him (see Note, CAR-D29-0002-0080). According to the\nYekatom Defence, this item contains ‘contemporaneous notes’ from a journalist of Radio Ndeke Luka who was\npresent in Mbaïki at the time (see Annex A to Yekatom Defence Request for the Formal Submission of Miscellaneous\nItems from the Bar Table, 29 August 2024, ICC-01/14-01/18-2661-Conf-AnxA, p. 2). Without further information on\nthe provenance of this document, its author, or the sources mentioned – according to the note ‘quelques jeunes’ which\nwere met –, the Chamber does not rely on this information to the detriment of the other information on the incident\nbefore it. Indeed, Alexandre Kouroupe-Awo, commenting on this note, testified that he heard that ‘when the group of\nAnti-Balaka, young people’ arrived at Saleh’s house, he threatened to attack them, but Alexandre Kouroupe-Awo did\nnot receive any details as to Saleh having a weapon or wounding any of the people (see P-1813: T-182, p. 64, line 1 –\np. 65, line 3). Another suggestion that Saleh would have been attacked ‘by his own neighbours’ (see Special Advisor\nStatement, CAR-OTP-2001-0446, at 0446) or by a ‘mob’ (see Press Article, CAR-D29-0002-0686) does not, in the\nChamber’s view, in and of itself exclude the participation in the killing of individuals affiliated with Mr Yekatom’s\ngroup.

The Chamber finds P-1786’s\naccount the least reliable one. First, according to P-1786, he heard that Saleh started\nattacking some people close to his house before he was attacked. Yet none of the other\nwitnesses mentioned this. On the contrary, and as set out above, the evidence indicates that\nSaleh was in his house with his family when he was suddenly attacked by a number of\nindividuals, at which point he tried to defend himself.9006 Second, P-1786 expressly indicated\nthat Saleh was not attacked with sticks or machetes, which contradicts the video footage\nshowing individuals beating Saleh with axes, machetes, sticks and knives.9007 Third, P-1786\nwas not present during this incident and heard about it from others.\nAs for the accounts of Stéphane Chrisostome Dawili and P-1339, the Chamber notes that\nboth witnesses involved at least one Anti-Balaka element in Saleh’s killing, Honorine\nGbafolo. Stéphane Chrisostome Dawili seemed to indicate that those who initiated the attack\nand killed Saleh were civilians of Mbaïki, with the element ‘Mama Tia Godobe’ taking part\nin the killing. P-1339 indicated that an Anti-Balaka chief and two elements killed Saleh, and\nthat Honorine Gbafolo herself explained to [REDACTED] what she had done and why. The\nChamber considers that both accounts are reliable and not necessarily contradictory with\neach other. In light of this evidence, the Chamber disregards P-1786’s evidence stating that\nit was ‘the youth of Mbaïki’ and not the Anti-Balaka who killed Saleh, also bearing in mind\nthat he subsequently stated not knowing whether ‘Mama Tia Godobe’ had been involved in\nthe killing.9008\nSpecifically with regard to Honorine Gbafolo, the Chamber notes that the video footage of\nthe mistreatment of Saleh’s body shows, as described above, an individual approaching the\n9004 P-1786: T-197, p. 88, lines 9-15.\n9005 P-1786: T-197, p. 89, line 18 – p. 90, line 1, p. 90, lines 18-20.\n9006 See paragraph 3644 above.\n9007 See paragraph 3646 above.\n9008 P-1786: T-197, p. 89, line 18 – p. 90, line 1, p. 90, lines 18-20.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 1225/1616 24 July 2025",

Further, the Chamber notes that some minutes later, an individual mentioned that ‘[c]’est cette maman-\nci qui a coupé le pénis’, after which someone said ‘[b]onjour’, followed by another individual who ordered not to\nmention any person (‘[n]on, on ne cite personne’) (see Video, CAR-OTP-2059-0384, at approximately 00:11:35-\n00:11:55; Translation, CAR-OTP-2118-5633, at 5643, lines 300-302).

However,\nRaymond Mongbandi and Guerrino Perin did not witness the killing. It also notes that\nRaymond Mongbandi and P-2353 indicated that Anti-Balaka elements killed Saleh based on\ntheir assumption that it could not have been any other group. The Chamber, therefore, puts\nlittle weight on this part of their evidence. As for Alexandre Kouroupe-Awo’s and Diakité\nAboubakar’s accounts, it notes that both witnesses were in touch with people who witnessed\nthe killing and who informed them almost immediately. Importantly, it notes that both\nAlexandre Kouroupe-Awo and Diakité Aboubakar indicated that according to their\ninformants, Saleh was attacked by a mixture of local people from Mbaïki and Anti-Balaka\nelements. Guerrino Perin also seemed to refer to both the Anti-Balaka and ‘others’ looking\nfor revenge as those responsible for Saleh’s killing. The Chamber further notes that P-2354\nstated that he recognised ‘some of the youngsters from Mbaïki’ in a film clip, whose names\nhe did not know. Regarding P-1823’s account, the Chamber notes that the witness’s source\ntold him that he had witnessed the killing of Saleh by the Anti-Balaka.\nIn this context, the Chamber further notes that the video footage depicting the mistreatment\nof Saleh’s body shows individuals who appear young and are wearing civilian clothes.9048\nAt the same time, the Chamber notes that also Honorine Gbafolo – who, as outlined above,\nwas identified by several witnesses as an element of Mr Yekatom’s group –, appears in\ncivilian clothing in the footage.9049 Furthermore, it was generally known that elements of\n9044 D29-5015: T-255, p. 20, lines 15-21.\n9045 D29-5015: T-255, p. 20, lines 15-25.\n9046 D29-5015: T-255, p. 20, lines 15-25.\n9047 D29-5015: T-255, p. 21, line 24 – p. 22, line 3.\n9048 See e.g. Video, CAR-OTP-2059-0384, at approximately 00:00:28-00:00:35, 00:06:49-00:07:15.\n9049 Video, CAR-OTP-2059-0384, at approximately 00:12:24-00:13:02.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 1230/1616 24 July 2025",

The Chamber has further considered in this context the evidence\nindicating that Saleh had already received threats by the Anti-Balaka before his death and,\nin particular, Raymond Mongbandi’s account according to which Mr Yekatom’s elements,\nincluding his deputy Cœur de Lion, interrogated Saleh prior to his death – an interrogation\nwhich Raymond Mongbandi considered ‘rather rough’ and ‘a kind of intimidation’ which\nmade the witness think that the Anti-Balaka wanted to kill Saleh.9051\nIn relation to the threats Saleh received, the Chamber is of the view that even if some of\nthese threats were based on Saleh’s alleged cooperation with the Seleka,9052 which, according\nto the Yekatom Defence, would have fuelled the ‘mob’s’ anger in his regard,9053 this does\nnot distract from the conclusion that at the time he was attacked while in his house, Saleh\nwas not engaged in any hostile activities, that he was one of the very few remaining Muslims\nin Mbaïki, and that the comments in the video showing the mistreatment of Saleh’s body\nleave no doubt that he was killed because he was a Muslim. In this regard, the Chamber\nnotes that once they killed Saleh, the perpetrators not only mistreated his body by beating it\nand cutting several parts of it but also by displaying a particularly cruel and humiliating\nbehaviour towards Saleh which included partly undressing him, insulting and making fun of\nhim, discussing ways in which to further harm him (including burning his body and eating\n9050 See e.g. audio-visual material referenced in footnote 7560 above; see also paragraphs 2411, 3475, 3501.\n9051 See paragraph 3640 above.\n9052 In this regard, the Chamber notes that P-1666 testified that after Saleh told him during a call that he was being\nthreatened and attacked, after which someone apparently took Saleh’s phone from him, he called a neighbour of Saleh,\nwho told him that a group of people had attacked him and accused him of ‘sheltering some people’ (see P-1666: T-\n231, p. 40, lines 2-21, p. 41, line 24 – p. 42, line 6).\n9053 Yekatom Defence Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2737-Corr-Red, paras 537-538.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 1231/1616 24 July 2025",

Recruitment of children under the age of 15 into the Anti-Balaka and their use\nMr Yekatom is charged with conscription and/or enlistment of children under the age of 15\nin his group at various locations, including Boeing, Sekia, Pissa, and Batalimo, and the\nassignment of various tasks to them, such as participating in hostilities, including during the\nBangui Attack, between ‘at least December 2013 and August 2014’.9091\n9087 P-1813: T-180, p. 37, lines 6-16.\n9088 Yekatom Defence Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2737-Corr-Red, para. 546.\n9089 See paragraphs 3650, 3681 above.\n9090 The Chamber notes in this regard that the Yekatom Defence seems to also imply that the fact that the ‘Anti-Balaka’\nwere to be re-grouped in a ‘safe place’ is contradictory with the idea that they would have been ‘expelled’ from Mbaïki\n(see Yekatom Defence Closing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2737-Corr-Red, para. 546 referring to Note, CAR-D29-0002-\n0080). The Chamber disagrees with this reading, as the document clearly states that regrouping the ‘Anti-balaka dans\nun lieu sûr’ was one of the factors discussed – in addition to support of MISCA and re-formation of defence and\nsecurity forces – with a view to facilitating ‘la libre circulation des personnes et leurs biens’. Rather than contradicting\nthe idea of an ‘expulsion’ of Mr Yekatom’s elements from Mbaïki, this makes clear that regrouping the elements in\none place was considered a factor which would contribute to ensuring free circulation of people and goods. Also\nbearing in mind its general considerations regarding this item (see footnote 9002 above), the Chamber therefore does\nnot find this to undermine its conclusion.\n9091 Confirmation Decision, ICC-01/14-01/18-403-Conf-Corr, para. 154, p. 105.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 1236/1616 24 July 2025",

These witnesses did not have any other information to offer\nthat could have assisted the Chamber in objectively assessing these observations or\nestimates.\nBased on his own assessment of their physical assessment at the time, P-1974 saw six\nchildren who may have been under 15 years old at an Anti-Balaka roadblock in Sekia and\nabout seven children at the Pissa checkpoints whose ages he estimated to be between 9-15\nyears.9133 P-2018 said that he saw children at Anti-Balaka roadblocks in Pissa,9134 however,\nhe was unable to reliably ascertain their age during this visit.9135\nRoger Okoa-Penguia stated that, on 30 January 2014, he saw children aged ‘10 upwards’ in\nthe towns of Pissa and Mbaïki who were with the Anti-Balaka, basing his estimates of their\nage on his own assessments as a father and a grandfather.9136 The witness seemed unable\nfrom his observations to distinguish between alleged ‘child soldiers’, or children abandoned\nor orphaned because of the crisis who were following the Anti-Balaka in their advance to\nMbaïki.9137 Roger Okoa-Penguia also had information from P-2018 about children in the\nAnti-Balaka in Lobaye but did not have information as to their ages.9138\nWhen Alexandre Kouroupe-Awo passed by Anti-Balaka posts at Sekia and Pissa several\ntimes in around January-February 2014, he saw often fewer than 10 ‘young boys’ which he\nestimated in his statement to be ‘from 10 years old’, while thinking in court that they were\n9133 P-1974: T-227, p. 19, line 1 – p. 22, line 22.

See paragraphs 616-621 above.\n9135 P-2018 thought these children might have been within the age range of 14-16 years, basing this on the fact that\nthese were the same ‘children’ that later on participated in the ESF programme where they self-reported their age (see\nP-2018: T-222, p. 25, lines 4-14, p. 26, lines 9 – p. 27, line 4; T-223, p. 43, line 24 – p. 44, line 23).\n9136 P-2084 Statement, CAR-OTP-2094-0968-R02, at 0985, para. 87.\n9137 P-2084: T-233, p. 14, line 5 – p. 15, line 14.\n9138 P-2084 Statement, CAR-OTP-2094-0968-R02, at 0985-86, para. 89.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 1243/1616 24 July 2025",

In particular, it argues that the term ‘child soldier’ varied between witnesses and\nwas not necessarily aligned with the legal criteria and Guerrino Perin was one such example\nbecause he said that there were no ‘child soldiers’ enlisted in Lobaye, and yet talked about\nthe children being present at roadblocks carrying out various tasks.9144\nIn the view of the Chamber, Guerrino Perin’s evidence did not point to the existence of\nchildren under 15 years of age enlisted within Mr Yekatom’s group; while he did notice\nchildren at the roadblocks, he was clearly pointing to the children in the villages (‘ils sont là\n[…] dans le village’) who were having ‘having fun’ (‘ils s’amusent’).9145 Same is true of\nD29-6035 who talked about three children who were related to Mr Yekatom’s girlfriend at\n9139 P-1813 Second Statement, CAR-OTP-2083-0279-R01, at 0283, para. 21; P-1813: T-180, p. 46, line 25 – p. 47,\nline 25, p. 50, lines 2-10.

However, based on what is before it, the Chamber cannot conclude\nthat these were indeed children under the age of 15 that had been enlisted or conscripted as\nmembers of Mr Yekatom’s group or were otherwise directly associated with that group’s\nactivities.

The agreements signed at the National\nForum of Bangui from 2015 contain language aimed at politico-military groups, including\nthe Anti-Balaka, who undertook to (i) stop all forms of recruitment and use of children,\nmeaning those below 18 years old, in their activities before, during, and after the DDR\nprocess; (ii) ensure the immediate identification and separation of children from their\nrespective groups and their handover to competent authorities for reintegration; and (iii) sign\nconcrete action plans to, inter alia, prevent and stop the recruitment and use of children.9198\nThe Chamber does not rely on these reports or agreements to ascertain whether all or some\nof the children subject of these reports were indeed under the age of 15 years or members of\nMr Yekatom’s group during the relevant period. First, the Chamber had no means to\n9196 The Report of the UNSG on the situation in the CAR from December 2013 noted that there was widespread\nrecruitment of children by the Anti-Balaka in villages as this movement spread across the CAR (see Report, CAR-\nOTP-2001-0329, at 0337, para. 42). A report by the UNOCHA from May 2014 stated that UNICEF and its partners\nconfirmed the presence of 53 children (46 boys and 7 girls) aged between 11 and 17 associated with Anti-Balaka\ngroups in Bangui’s PK10 neighbourhood and stated that between January and May 2014, 1,035 children (227 girls\nand 808 boys) were confirmed within ranks of armed groups in Bangui, Boali, Ngala Fondo, Sibut and Zemio (see\nReport, CAR-OTP-2001-0782, at 0784). A similar report from October 2014 speaks of 10,000 children associated\nwith armed groups in CAR, stating that between January and September 2014, 2,040 children were demobilised from\nthese armed groups (see Report, CAR-OTP-2127-4064, at 4072). An internal document from the UN-OLA dated\nDecember 2013 mentions the presence of ‘armed children of young age’ within an Anti-Balaka camp led by ‘Konaté’\npresent near the airport (see Report, CAR-OTP-2110-0935, at 0938, paras 11-12). Reports of the UNSG on the\nsituation in CAR from 2013 and 2014 noted that children were recruited by both the Seleka and the Anti-Balaka (see\nReports, CAR-OTP-2001-0329, at 0337-38; CAR-OTP-2001-1057, at 1060, 1067). A report of the UNSG on children\nand armed conflict from May 2014 stated that both the Anti-Balaka and the Seleka coalition systematically recruited\nand used children, also pointing out that the progressive deterioration of the security environment also led to\nsubsequent re-recruitment of children by other armed groups (see Report, CAR-OTP-2001-0987, at 0995, para. 38).\nThe Final Report of the International Commission of Inquiry on the CAR stated that the commission had reasonable\ngrounds to believe that all parties to the conflict used child soldiers (see Commission of Inquiry Report, CAR-OTP-\n2001-7017, at 7124, para. 506). The Panel of Experts on the CAR noted being informed about the presence of children\nin Seleka and Anti-Balaka groups in multiple locations in the CAR (see Report, CAR-OTP-2001-5386, at 5438-39,\nparas 213-216). See further Accord de cessation des hostilités en RCA, CAR-OTP-2001-3405, at 3407-08, Articles 2\nand 5(e), dated July 2014, that prohibited the recruitment and use of child soldiers, and parties to the agreement\nundertook not to recruit children as combatants, in accordance with the various international agreements.\n9197 For example, a Human Rights Watch report from January 2014 stated that children were commonly seen among\nthe Seleka and that even more children appeared to have been mobilised to join Anti-Balaka ranks. See Report, CAR-\nOTP-2001-7145, at 7158. Child Soldiers International outlined, inter alia, the practices among armed groups,\nincluding the Anti-Balaka, in the CAR in respect of the recruitment and use of children in the years 2012 to 2015 that\nculminated in the pledges at the Bangui Forum 2015 regarding the release and non-recruitment of children within\narmed groups.

The Chamber found that after threatening them with death and\naccusing them of being traitors, Alkanto ordered his elements to take the seven persons,\nincluding Saint Cyr Lapo N’Gomat, P-1704, P-1705, P-1716, P-0967 and P-1811, to\nYamwara.9864\nThe Chamber considered the circumstances of their treatment at Yamwara. The Chamber\nfound that elements in Mr Yekatom’s group, namely Alkanto and others, brought the\ncaptives to Cœur de Lion’s house at Yamwara. There, in Cœur de Lion’s presence, elements\nin Mr Yekatom’s group, including Bojos, interrogated the four men individually on their\nidentity, ethnicity, and reasons for being there with the women, also demanding the captive\nmen to speak in the dialect associated with their respective ethnicities.9865\nThe Chamber considered how P-1704, P-1705, P-1716, and Saint Cyr were treated after their\ninterrogation at Yamwara. The Chamber found that following the men’s interrogation, the\nelements in Mr Yekatom’s group forced them to undress, searched them again, threatened\nthem with death, and found no weapons on any of them.9866\nThe Chamber considered how P-0967, P-1811, and one other captive were treated at\nYamwara. The Chamber found that the elements in Mr Yekatom’s group kept the women\napart but close by, under the veranda of Cœur de Lion’s house.9867 Then Mr Yekatom’s\ngroup took the women inside Cœur de Lion’s house while Saint Cyr’s interrogation\ncontinued outside, and from where they could hear what was happening outside.

During this time, Saint Cyr’s physical\nmovement was restricted and under the control of Mr Yekatom’s elements, by virtue of\nthreats of death addressed to the whole group of seven, and beatings. Mr Yekatom’s elements\nat Yamwara then interrogated him about his ethnicity, broke his legs, tied him up in\n‘arbatacher’ manner, and maimed him.

All five of them were initially brought\ntogether to Yamwara together with P-1716 and Saint Cyr.\nIn assessing the severity of deprivation of liberty for P-1704 and P-1705, the Chamber has\nadditionally considered the fact that they were both present when Saint Cyr was tortured and\nthat Mr Yekatom’s elements also beat them and threatened them with death around this\ntime.9888\nHaving regard to the overall circumstances of their captivity, as discussed above, the\nChamber finds that the severity threshold for the deprivation of physical liberty is met in\nrespect of P-0967, P-1811, P-1704, P-1705, and another captive. The Chamber is convinced\nthat the severity requirement is met in respect of all the seven persons that were abducted at\nthe checkpoint and brought to Yamwara, regardless of whether it may have been for ‘one\nevening’, as argued by Yekatom Defence.\nOn this basis, the Chamber finds that the requirement in respect of the first element of\nimprisonment and other forms of severe deprivation of physical liberty as a crime against\nhumanity, pursuant to Article 7(1)(e) of the Statute, namely that the perpetrator imprisoned\none or more persons or otherwise severely deprived one or more persons of physical liberty,\nis met.\nGravity of conduct in violation of fundamental rules of\ninternational law\nTurning now to the second element of imprisonment and other forms of severe deprivation\nof physical liberty as a crime against humanity, pursuant to Article 7(1)(e) of the Statute,\n9886 See paragraph 107 above.\n9887 See paragraph 110 above.\n9888 See paragraphs 101-102 above.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 1402/1616 24 July 2025",

In the Chamber’s view,\nMr Yekatom continued to be aware and engaged in the depriving the five captives of their\nphysical liberty. Having regard to this, the Chamber cannot conclude that Mr Yekatom\nindeed intervened in relation to the release of the five captives.\nFurther, in the view of the Chamber, even accepting that Mr Yekatom did intervene, this\nwould not have reduced the severity of the deprivation of physical liberty.

Bojos was one of\nMr Yekatom’s elements that interrogated the male captives at Yamwara. It was in Cœur de\nLion’s house where Mr Yekatom’s element kept the female captives at gunpoint. Similarly,\nit was under Cœur de Lion’s watch that P-1716 was kept overnight at Yamwara. P-1716’s\nfather paid a ransom to both Cœur de Lion and Mr Yekatom for P-1716’s release.\nIn respect of the female captives, Mr Yekatom instrumentalised his elements to apprehend,\nsearch, interrogate, and threaten them with death at various points during their captivity.\nMr Yekatom’s elements kept the three women under the veranda of Cœur de Lion’s house\nduring this time and were taken later inside his house where they were kept under\ngunpoint.9958 When Mr Yekatom was in Yamwara later that evening, he himself met the\nthree female captives inside this house on 24 December 2013 and questioned them about\ntheir ethnicities and family background.9959 Following this, Mr Yekatom’s elements further\nkept the five captives, including the three female captives, in another location at Yamwara,\nafter regrouping them following Saint Cyr’s torture, and threatened them with death.9960\nMr Yekatom used Sylvestre Yagouzou in keeping the five captives at a base close to the\nairport, surrounded by Anti-Balaka elements.9961\nThe Chamber recalls that Mr Yekatom’s elements used the phrase ‘peeling the papaya’ that\nhas been used in other contexts to refer to the treatment of captured Seleka.9962 When asked\nabout Saint Cyr’s treatment particularly, Mr Yekatom himself used this phrase.9963 In the\nview of the Chamber, this phrase spoke to a level of an understanding amongst\nMr Yekatom’s elements about a manner of mistreatment, and possible death, of those\nsuspected to be Seleka, despite being civilian.

This phrase\ndid, however, denote a power of Mr Yekatom to frustrate its execution, if needed. Neither\nCœur de Lion, given his position as Mr Yekatom’s deputy, nor any other elements within\nhis group, shared this power to frustrate the commission of acts, involving ‘peeling the\npapaya’.\nFurthermore, also in respect of the six persons, the Chamber considered that Mr Yekatom\nhad the sole power to end the deprivation of their physical liberty and their mistreatment\nduring their captivity by his elements. Mr Yekatom had the authority to issue the relevant\norders to require that his elements abide by the legal standards of treatment of the captives\nand to grant them procedural rights under international law and CAR domestic law. Despite\nthis, the Chamber notes that when Mr Yekatom arrived in Yamwara, the captivity and\nmistreatment of the six persons did not abate. The Chamber notes that Mr Yekatom did not\ntake any steps to ensure that the six persons were treated with dignity. The Chamber recalls\nthat when Mr Yekatom met with Saint Cyr’s father, P-1654, at Yamwara that evening, the\nfive captives were not sent home. The five captives continued to be kept at gunpoint at\nanother location in Yamwara where Mr Yekatom’s elements again threatened to kill them.\nThe Chamber found that, subsequently, Mr Yekatom’s elements brought the five captives to\nanother location close to the M’Poko airport. The Chamber considers that this did not mean\nthat Mr Yekatom relinquished control over the five captives. The Chamber found that\nMr Yekatom’s elements coordinated with Wenezoui and Sylvestre Yagouzou and the Anti-\nBalaka based behind the M’Poko airport in the transfer and captivity of the five captives.9964\nThe Chamber further found that Mr Yekatom met the five captives again when they were\nbeing kept in the base close to the airport.9965 In the view of the Chamber, this signalled that\nMr Yekatom continued to maintain control over the term of their captivity, its conditions,\nand their treatment. The Chamber notes that at no point until the release of the captives, did\nMr Yekatom exercise his prerogative to release the six persons when he met Saint Cyr’s\nfather, P-1654, earlier.

Efforts to promote peace, reconciliation\nand social cohesion\nThe Yekatom Defence argues that Mr Yekatom made genuine and sustained personal efforts\nto promote peace and reconciliation across the CAR, both before and after the period relevant\nto the charges,10280 particularly highlighting his activities as a member of parliament.10281 It\nfurther submits that Mr Yekatom took concrete steps to restore social cohesion across the\nCAR and particularly in the Lobaye prefecture, referring to his efforts to allow for the return\nof Muslims to their homes, the reopening of mosques and cemeteries, and that he played a\nsignificant role in providing educational and economic opportunities for the youth in\nLobaye.10282\nThe Prosecution and CLRV2 submit that the suggestion that Mr Yekatom worked towards\nthe promotion of peace is ‘an affront to the enumerable victims of the crimes committed by\nhis own Anti-Balaka group’ and does not conform with the evidence.10283\nAt the outset, the Chamber recalls its findings above addressing Mr Yekatom’s purported\nactivities aimed at peace and reconciliation.10284 Furthermore, the Chamber takes note of all\nof the Yekatom Defence’s submissions10285 and evidence submitted for the purposes of\nsentencing in this regard10286 and addresses them below to the extent that it considers them\nrelevant to its assessment of this mitigating factor.\n10280 Yekatom Defence Sentencing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2746-Red, p. 17.

Notably, the Chamber is of the view that at least\nsome of these actions seem to primarily have been motivated by Mr Yekatom’s personal\neconomic and political interests, considering, in particular, that he was running to be elected\nas a parliamentarian in the 2016 elections.10313 Relatedly, the Chamber also considers\nMr Yekatom’s actions as a member of parliament10314 to be predominantly politically\nmotivated and of no interest to the present assessment.\nIn conclusion, the Chamber accepts that Mr Yekatom may have wished for peace to return\nto the CAR once the Anti-Balaka’s objectives had been accomplished and that he took\ncertain efforts towards this goal. Nonetheless, taking all of the above considerations into\naccount, the Chamber only considers the abovementioned peace and reconciliation activities\nwhich were made after the period relevant to the charges and only affords them limited\nweight in mitigating Mr Yekatom’s sentence.\nvi.

Rather, the Yekatom Defence’s\narguments are limited to highlighting isolated and selective acts,10318 which at times seem to\nbe mainly motivated by ulterior reasons. In this regard, the Chamber particularly notes that\nMr Yekatom’s involvement in assisting D29-5014’s Muslim family, who were subjected to\nviolence in the PK9 area towards the end of January or early February 2014,10319 must be\nviewed in light of the fact that the witness had a relationship with the Beina family.10320\nNoting that Habib Beina was a high-level element in Mr Yekatom’s group10321 and\npersonally close to him, it is clear that Mr Yekatom had a personal interest in their protection.\nIn light of the above, and in accordance with the jurisprudence of this Court,10322 the\nChamber does not consider it appropriate to consider these sporadic and selective efforts\ngenerally mitigating, particularly considering the large number of crimes Mr Yekatom\ncommitted in parallel to these alleged acts of kindness, as well as their heinous nature.\nHowever, to the extent that the judgment discusses specific instances of Mr Yekatom’s\npurported efforts to assist victims of the specific crimes he is convicted of, the Chamber\nassesses them in the context of determining the individual sentences below.10323\n10318 The Chamber notes the specific incidents referred to in the Yekatom Defence Sentencing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-\n2746-Red, paras 35-37 and Yekatom Defence Oral Sentencing Submissions: T-311, p. 20, line 5 – p. 22, line 1.\n10319 See paragraphs 1638-1639 above.

Salehou Ndiaye further stated that a crowd of locals followed the ‘Anti-\nBalaka’ and were ‘encouraging them’.10379\nAs to the murders at the market in Boeing, the Chamber recalls that when Mr Yekatom’s\ngroup reached the market, the armed elements in the front fired at the Muslim traders who\nwere present there. During this time, Mr Yekatom’s elements shot in all directions.10380 The\nChamber further recalls that neither of the two unnamed Muslim traders who were killed\nwere armed at the time of their murders.10381 In relation to Hassan’s death specifically, the\nChamber recalls P-1339’s evidence according to which, after Mr Yekatom fired a shot in the\nair and his elements ‘launched the attack’, Hassan received a bullet and died after he ‘left his\nshop with [a] weapon to defend himself’.10382 The Chamber considers that the violent nature\nof the crime is demonstrated by the weapons that were used – including a grenade which\nwas thrown into ‘the house’ that propelled Hassan outside his shop – and the fact that Hassan\nwas attacked whilst he was in his shop, on the basis that generally a person can reasonably\nexpect less harm to occur when inside their own property.10383\n10376 See paragraphs 77, 79, 3966-3971 above.

It notes that they endured the\nloss of their family members,10407 loss of their home, loss of their belongings, and sense of\nmaterial and non-material unsafety for prolonged periods.10408 The displaced persons\nexperienced fear and threats to physical security, a lack of freedom of movement, and a fear\nof being identified as a Muslim following the events.10409 Notably, Muslims who fled to PK5\ncontinued to feel threatened by the Anti-Balaka’s presence in and around PK5 and Bangui.\nThis climate of fear contributed to the lack of freedom of movement within and outside of\nPK5. It made it almost impossible to leave PK5 safely.10410This is illustrated by P-2472 who\nexplained that after the Bangui Attack, there were ‘continuous attacks by the Anti-Balaka\nagainst the Muslim population in [Bangui] for approximately three months.

We’re going to slit your throats’.10414\nFinally, the Chamber notes the testimony of Salehou Ndiaye who indicated that whilst some\nMuslims who used to live in Boeing and Cattin were able to return to the places where they\nlived before ‘the events’, others were not.10415 He also described how his family has been\naffected.10416 Whilst he returned to the CAR, he lives in a one bedroom flat and does not\nhave the financial resources to bring his family back to live with him – he tries ‘to survive,\ncovering the expenses in both places, [REDACTED] and in Bangui’.10417 He explained how\nthis affected him emotionally, noting that ‘the fact that I’m far away from my family and my\nfamily is far away from me, this is very difficult’.10418 He also explained the effects that the\nevents had on him generally, that it is ‘very, very difficult to forget all that happened’, ‘it’s\na source of pain’, and he avoids going to where he used to live because ‘all this comes\nflooding back’ causing him to ‘spend a sleepless night’.10419\n10412 See paragraphs 80, 2741-2744 above.\n10413 See paragraph 2743 above.\n10414 See paragraphs 2699-2700 above.

In\nparticular, it recalls that on 5 December 2013, and following Mr Yekatom’s instructions,\nMr Yekatom’s elements attacked the Boeing Mosque using a ‘rocket’, a destructive weapon,\nand torched it with gasoline – both of which had the potential to cause a significant amount\nof damage.10442\nThe Chamber recalls that whilst there is no results requirement in the elements of this war\ncrime, it may consider harm arising as a consequence of a crime in the context of\nsentencing.10443\nIn addition to the physical damage caused to the Boeing Mosque, the Chamber notes the\nspecific emotional and psychological impact caused to the local Muslim community. In this\nregard, the Chamber recalls the particular significance of the Boeing Mosque as the main\nmosque to the communities of Boeing and Cattin, where around 100 Muslim families lived\nat the time.10444 It notes the testimony of Salehou Ndiaye who explained that during a period\nof ‘six or seven years’ between the attack on the Boeing Mosque and the resumption of\nprayers at that location, the Muslim community had to find alternative places to pray and\nmeet. Salehou Ndiaye stated that he believed that some Muslims started doing daily prayers\nat home and some would go to PK5 as it was the closest neighbourhood with mosques.10445\nHe also explained that religious buildings ‘are places where people take refuge when there\nare problems’, that ‘it hurts’ and he was ‘sad’ to see the Boeing Mosque destroyed.10446\nConsidering the nature of Mr Yekatom’s specific acts and conduct in the context of the Anti-\nBalaka’s attack on Boeing and Cattin10447 and the means used by Mr Yekatom’s elements to\n10442 See paragraph 78 above.

The Chamber also notes the expert report of Daryn Reicherter which concludes that\nthe destruction of culturally significant property and religious sites has ‘profound psychological effects’ and has thus\n‘long been weaponised in war’. It notes that in the CAR specifically, ‘civilians sought refuge in places of worship and\ncultural significance’ and the targeting of such buildings ‘would have led to an accumulation of stress and lack of a\nsense of safety’. See Daryn Reicherter Expert Report, CAR-OTP-2127-6805, at 6827-28.

Crimes committed within the context of the events at Yamwara on\nand around 24 December 2013 (Counts 11 to 17)\nThe Chamber observes that the crimes committed in the context of the events at Yamwara\nshare a number of features,10459 in particular as concerns Mr Yekatom’s individual\nresponsibility. In this respect, the Chamber recalls its findings above.10460 Notably, it recalls\nthat Mr Yekatom is convicted of committing the crimes underlying Counts 11 to 17 through\nothers pursuant to Article 25(3)(a) of the Statute.\nIn determining Mr Yekatom’s degree of participation and intent for the purposes of\nsentencing, the Chamber notes that Mr Yekatom was not present when his elements took the\nseven persons to Yamwara and interrogated them.10461 Mr Yekatom was also not present\nduring the mistreatment of Saint Cyr, P-1704, P-1705, and P-1716 in front of Cœur de Lion’s\n10458 See section VI.B.2; section VI.B.3.i; paragraphs 4492-4499 above.\n10459 In this respect, the Chamber notes that these features are addressed jointly for all crimes merely for clarity and\navoidance of duplication. However, it emphasises that it has taken each of these findings into account when\ndetermining the individual sentences below.\n10460 See paragraphs 36, 48, 55, 63; section II.D.3, in particular paragraphs 103-107, 110-111; paragraphs 1299, 1305;\nsection V.B.3.iii.b.i above.\n10461 See paragraph 100 above. Recalling the Appeals Chamber’s jurisprudence that physical proximity to the\ncommission of crimes ‘may be indicative of the degree of participation of an individual in certain circumstances’ (see\nNtaganda Sentencing Appeals Judgment, ICC-01/04-02/06-2667-Red, paras 1, 45), the Chamber considers that the\nlack thereof may equally inform its determination in the present circumstances.

In this\nrespect, it refers to its findings above.10470\nThe Chamber is mindful that certain factual findings on Mr Yekatom’s acts only pertain to\nspecific crimes committed at Yamwara. Where this is the case, they are discussed in the\ncontext of the relevant crimes below. Nonetheless, these differences do not lead to different\nconclusions regarding Mr Yekatom’s degree of participation and intent for the individual\ncrimes committed. On the contrary, taking all of the above as well as the below crime-\nspecific considerations into account, the Chamber considers Mr Yekatom’s degree of\nparticipation to be significant and his intent high for each of the crimes underlying Counts\n11 to 17.\nAnother feature common to all crimes committed at Yamwara is their commission for\nmotives involving discrimination. In this regard, the Chamber recalls that the seven persons\nwere targeted by Mr Yekatom’s group on the basis that they were perceived to be Muslims,\nas well as Mr Yekatom’s intent in that regard.10471 Alkanto, who led the checkpoint at which\nthe seven persons were apprehended, and over whom Mr Yekatom had undisputed authority,\nidentified the female captives as being related to Michel Djotodia and Mamour as well as\nbeing Muslims, and ordered their transfer to Yamwara. This identification marked the\nbeginning of various death threats expressed by his group against all seven persons.10472\nMr Yekatom’s and his elements’ discriminatory approach is further demonstrated by virtue\nof their interrogating of the six persons, as well as P-1654, about their ethnicity and\ndemanding the male captives to speak in the dialect associated therewith.10473 As indicated\n10469 Yekatom Defence Sentencing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2746-Red, para. 35 referring to Yekatom Defence Closing\nBrief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2737-Conf-Corr, para. 463 and the references cited therein.

Moreover, it recalls that Mr Yekatom himself interrogated the female\ncaptives about their ethnicities and family background and, together with other elements, questioned P-1654 about his\nfamily, including about his ethnicity.

It considers\nthat the particular circumstances of their treatment are more appropriately accounted for in\nthe Chamber’s assessment of the circumstances of manner, location and means employed to\nexecute the crime pursuant to Rule 145(i)(c) of the Rules below.\nLastly, the Chamber considers that the following circumstances should be taken into account\nin assessing Counts 11 to 17, as they concern the nature of the unlawful behaviour and the\nmeans employed, as well as the impact of the crimes.\nFirst, the Chamber finds that the environment set up by the Anti-Balaka at Yamwara was\ndeliberately vicious and chosen to increase the suffering of the seven persons.10477 Notably,\nit recalls that Yamwara was a base with approximately 1,000 Anti-Balaka elements\npresent10478 and that the captives were brought there only a few weeks after the Bangui\nAttack, during which Mr Yekatom’s elements had killed Muslim civilians.10479 The Chamber\nalso considers it relevant that some of Mr Yekatom’s elements, who kept the seven persons\ncaptive, were armed and continuously demonstrated their willingness to use their weapons\nagainst the captives.10480 For instance, when the three women were being kept inside Cœur\nde Lion’s house, an element at the main entrance had a weapon pointed in their direction.10481\n10474 See section VI.B.2.i.a above.\n10475 With respect to Count 17, the Chamber recalls that the discriminatory dimension is a constitutive element of the\ncrime against humanity of persecution. Accordingly, the Chamber does not consider it as an aggravating factor for\nthis crime.\n10476 Prosecution Sentencing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2747-Red, paras 23-24; Prosecution Oral Sentencing\nSubmissions: T-310, p. 39, line 20 – p. 40, line 6.

This fact was\nknown to Mr Yekatom and his elements.10493 In this respect, the Chamber recalls in particular\nthat the deceased was Saint Cyr’s [REDACTED] older brother and that the six persons, who\nwere family members or friends of the Lapo N’Gomat family, were apprehended by\nMr Yekatom’s group only hours after some of them had transported his dead body from the\nhospital to his family home.10494\nThird, the Chamber is mindful of the impact of the crimes committed at Yamwara and the\nAnti-Balaka’s continued presence in its vicinity. Notably, these crimes caused multiple\nharms to the surviving captives, in particular Saint Cyr’s family members, as further\ndiscussed below. Furthermore, these crimes and their continue presence created an\nenvironment of fear, which forced at least [REDACTED], [REDACTED] and P-1654 and\nhis family to flee.10495\nThe Chamber considers that all of these harms were objectively foreseeable to Mr Yekatom.\nIn this respect, it recalls that Mr Yekatom, fully aware of the Anti-Balaka’s objectives and\npolicy, set up a base at Yamwara together with his group, as well as checkpoints along its\nperimeter to monitor the passage of vehicles and people.10496 He was aware that FACA\nmembers of his group, who also trained civilian elements, bore strong anti-Muslim\nsentiments and feelings of vengeance against the Seleka and that his elements would not\ndistinguish between Seleka and Muslim civilians during combat.10497 Moreover, the resulting\nharms caused to the surviving captives of the Yamwara Incident by virtue of their\nmistreatment, as well as the impact on Saint Cyr’s family and friends as a result of his torture\n10492 See paragraph 98 above.\n10493 See paragraphs 106, 3160-3161 above.\n10494 See paragraphs 3131-3132 above.\n10495 See P-1654 Statement, CAR-OTP-2053-0112-R04, at 0118, paras 44-45; [REDACTED], p. 62, line 18 – p. 63,\nline 9; [REDACTED], p. 8, lines 18-23.

Imprisonment and other forms of severe\ndeprivation of physical liberty as a crime\nagainst humanity (Count 14)\nThe crime of imprisonment and other forms of severe deprivation of physical liberty as a\ncrime against humanity protects the liberty of physical movement, thus making it a crime of\nsubstantial gravity in the abstract.10498\nTurning to the assessment of the facts in concreto, the Chamber considers the gravity of\nCount 14 to be high. It recalls its findings above regarding the circumstances of and the\nmeans employed to execute all crimes committed at Yamwara, in particular the enormous\nbrutality exercised.10499 In this context, the Chamber takes into account that during their\ncaptivity, the seven persons not only had to endure the deprivation of their own liberty, but\nwere also exposed to parts of Saint Cyr’s mistreatment. Notably, the female captives were\nput in a situation where they had no choice but to listen and guess about his fate,10500 the men\nwitnessed his mistreatment first-hand.10501\nWith respect to P-1716, the Chamber recalls that, when the Five Captives were regrouped,\nhe was separated from the group and kept apart from them at Yamwara under Cœur de Lion’s\nwatch.10502 Mr Yekatom’s elements went as far as to show him where they had previously\nburied other people.10503 This isolation from the other captives and threats further\nexacerbated his already vulnerable position.\nWith respect to Saint Cyr, the Chamber notes that he was held captive at gunpoint and had\nto endure multiple barbaric physical assaults on his body.

P-1716 testified that he was ‘at the point of death, so\n[he] cannot forget what was happening’ and that the events ‘haunt’ him until today.10507 P-\n0967 stated ‘[i]t was horrible. It was very difficult. We didn’t think we were going to\nsurvive.’.10508\nFinally, the Chamber is not persuaded by the Yekatom Defence’s argument that Count 14 is\nof reduced gravity as the ‘duration of the alleged imprisonment of the Lapo family members\namounted to a single evening’.10509 First, this is not supported by the evidence for all\ncaptives: amongst the six persons, five were held from 24 until on or about 27 December\n2013,10510 and only P-1716’s detention lasted one night.10511 As regards Saint Cyr, the\nChamber notes that his captivity was cut short by no other reason than his murder by\nMr Yekatom’s elements.10512 Second, the Chamber is, in any event, of the view that the\nduration of the six persons’ captivity cannot be considered in isolation. Rather, it must be\nconsidered jointly with the other circumstances surrounding the events, as set out above and\nbelow.\n10504 See paragraph 101 above.\n10505 See paragraph 4220 above.\n10506 In this respect, the Chamber recalls that the crime is already fulfilled with the detention of only one person, see\nparagraph 3835 above.\n10507 P-1716: T-147, p. 15, lines 13-18.\n10508 P-0967: T-199, p. 48, line 23 – p. 49, line 1.\n10509 Yekatom Defence Sentencing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2746-Red, para. 20.

The witness further stated that they\nshowed him where they had previously buried other people and that the ground was indeed\n‘disturbed’ in these locations.10530 The Chamber finds this behaviour of constantly and\ngraphically reminding P-1716 that his survival was entirely in the control of Mr Yekatom’s\nelements, to exhibit particular cruelty.\nIn addition to the above, the Chamber also considers relevant that the crimes underlying\nCounts 11 and 13 were committed against a total of six individuals and the long-lasting\nimpact caused, as already touched upon above.10531 In this context, the Chamber particularly\nhighlights that P-1704 and P-1716 indicated that they continue to be haunted by the\nevents.10532 P-1704 stated that:\nI’m still haunted by what happened.

The right not to be subjected to torture is a non-derogable\nright recognised in customary and conventional international law10542 and as a norm of ius\ncogens. The gravity of this crime, both as a war crime and as a crime against humanity, must\ntherefore be considered very high in abstracto.10543\nTurning to the assessment of the facts in concreto, the Chamber considers the gravity of the\ncrimes underlying Counts 12 and 13 (torture of Saint Cyr) as particularly high. In this\nrespect, the Chamber highlights the circumstances of and the means employed to execute\nthese crimes.10544 While the crimes only concern one individual, Saint Cyr, the manner in\nwhich he was mistreated was particularly depraved and violent.10545 Notably, he was\nunarmed10546 and beaten by multiple perpetrators for a considerable amount of time. The\nassailants knocked Saint Cyr to the ground, used a stick to force him down on his knees10547\nand specifically beat his legs, breaking them. His hands and feet were tied together in the\nback in the ‘arbatacher’-style and despite his inability to defend himself, the assailants\ncontinued assaulting him.10548 Eventually an element in Mr Yekatom’s group went as far as\nto cut off his toes, fingers and an ear.10549\nThe Chamber further recalls that P-1716 considered Saint Cyr to be in ‘a very critical’ state\nwhen he was taken away, indicating that it was unlikely that he would still be alive.10550 P-\n10541 See similarly Ongwen Sentencing Judgment, ICC-02/04/01/15-1819-Red, para. 157.\n10542 See in particular article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (UNTS, Vol. 999 (1976), p.\n175); article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (GA/RES/217 A(III) of 10 December 1948); article 5 of\nthe African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights (UNTS, Vol. 1520 (1988), p. 247); article 5(2) American\nConvention on Human Rights (UNTS, Vol. 1144 (1979), p.145).\n10543 See also Al Hassan Sentencing Judgment, ICC-01/12-01/18-2662, para. 44; Ongwen Sentencing Judgment, ICC-\n02/04/01/15-1819-Red, para. 157.\n10544 See e.g. paragraphs 4558-4564 above.\n10545 See also Prosecution Sentencing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2747-Red, paras 14, 24; CLRV2 Sentencing Brief, ICC-\n01/14-01/18-2745-Red, paras 20, 51.\n10546 See paragraph 98 above.\n10547 See paragraph 3171 above.\n10548 See paragraph 101 above.\n10549 See paragraph 101 above.\n10550 See paragraph 3177 above.\nNo. ICC-01/14-01/18 1530/1616 24 July 2025",

At this time, the\nwomen were even scared to go to the market because the Anti-Balaka were walking\naround armed with knives and machetes. We had never seen anything like this.10605\nThe Chamber further highlights that some Muslim civilians were forced to leave twice in a\nshort amount of time – first from their villages and towns along the PK9-Mbaïki axis to\nMbaïki, and then again from Mbaïki to other locations in the CAR or abroad, notably to\nChad,10606 which contributed to victims’ hardship and the uncertainty of their situations.\nRegarding the removal from Mbaïki by Chadian forces, the Chamber recalls that Muslim\ncivilians were not allowed to get into the trucks with their belongings and had to leave them\nbehind,10607 they were treated harshly by Chadian soldiers to ensure their speedy\ndeparture,10608 some families were separated in the trucks,10609 and women and children were\nmore numerous than men in the trucks.10610 Further, witnesses stated that the travel\nconditions in the convoy to Chad were difficult, with no provision of food or water, and they\nwere attacked by the Anti-Balaka on the way.10611\nThe Chamber also notes that some of the individuals who were removed from Mbaïki, as\nwell as others who watched the scene, described the departure of Muslims from Mbaïki as a\ndifficult and emotional situation.10612 For instance, Diakité Aboubakar, who was removed\nfrom Mbaïki by the Congolese MISCA, testified that ‘[m]any were sad to see us leave.

In\nChad, Muslims who were unable to stay with relatives or to rent a house had to live in refugee\ncamps, where the living conditions were poor and extremely difficult.10614 P-2389 explained\nthat one refugee camp had no toilets and they had to build latrines, and the conditions for the\nchildren to learn were not ‘viable’.10615\nAs a result of their dislocation, many witnesses reported feeling that they had to ‘abandon\neverything’ and that they had ‘lost everything’.10616 The Chamber recalls P-1666’s testimony\nregarding his feelings on the day he was transported away from Mbaïki:\nWe didn’t think that one day we would leave from this town. You must remember, we\ninvested a lot. We built a lot up and all of a sudden we had to abandon everything and\nleave.

Regarding the latter, while some\nMuslim civilians may have eventually returned to the villages and towns along the PK9-\nMbaïki axis after the period relevant to the charges,10625 the evidence on the record in this\nrespect is scarce, mostly refers to an eventual return several years after the initial\ndisplacement, and, in any event, does not establish that all, or even a majority, were able to\nreturn to their villages or towns, or even to the CAR.\nIn this regard, the Chamber does not consider that the harm deriving from displacement\nnecessarily ended by virtue of either (i) an eventual return to the CAR from abroad; or (ii) for\nthose displaced within the CAR, settling elsewhere. The Chamber recalls that victims had to\nleave their houses and their belongings behind, and thus emphasises that their return to the\nCAR or their place of origin does not mean that they were able to reach the same standards\nof living or live in the same conditions as before,10626 and does not reduce the gravity of the\ncrimes as such.\nTurning to the arguments as to the necessity of a ‘cut-off point’, the Chamber recalls that it\nmay consider any consequences arising from the crimes in the context of sentencing, as long\nas they were objectively foreseeable to the accused.10627 In this regard, the Chamber\nconsiders that the harm described above, including beyond the initial displacement of\nvictims, is inherent to the nature of the crimes, derives from, and is sufficiently linked to\nthem.

It recalls that Mr Yekatom, Cœur de Lion\nand Alkanto instructed the elements to kill all the Muslims in the area, that elements under\nMr Yekatom’s command threatened and harassed Muslim civilians in Mbaïki – which\nMr Yekatom was aware of –, and further threatened Saleh as one of the very few remaining\nMuslims in town, and that Saleh was targeted and his body mistreated because he was a\nMuslim.10644 It also recalls that Mr Yekatom’s elements bore strong anti-Muslim sentiment\nand feelings of vengeance against the Seleka, which Mr Yekatom was aware of.10645 In the\ncircumstances, the Chamber considers that it was foreseeable for Mr Yekatom that in some\ninstances his elements’ attacks on Muslims would escalate and lead to such kind of\nmistreatment.\nFurther, the Chamber notes that Catherine Samba-Panza visited Mbaïki shortly before\nSaleh’s killing and held a speech in which she called on the Anti-Balaka in general to stop\nthe violence.10646 In that context, contemporaneous press articles and reports recognised the\nkilling of Saleh, whom they described as the deputy mayor and one of the last remaining\nMuslims in Mbaïki, as a particularly impactful and emblematic event.10647 The Chamber\n10640 See paragraphs 125, 3646, 3670 above.\n10641 See paragraphs 3646, 3670 above.\n10642 See paragraphs 3647, 3670 above.\n10643 See Video, CAR-OTP-2059-0384; paragraph 3647 above.\n10644 See paragraphs 114, 121, 124-125, 3670 above.\n10645 See paragraphs 74, 2452 above. The Chamber notes that while this discussion is situated in the Chamber’s\nevidentiary analysis of the Bangui Attack, it is equally relevant to the events that took place along the PK9-Mbaïki\naxis, in particular bearing in mind that elements such as Cœur de Lion, at least until his death, and Habib Beina were\nelements of the group throughout events during the Bangui Attack, Yamwara and along the PK9-Mbaïki axis.\n10646 See paragraph 3642 above.

For example, the\nChamber considers of note in this regard the testimony of Catherine Samba-Panza, who said\nthat Mr Ngaïssona’s statement of being ready to put down weapons was a ‘political spin’\n(‘effets d’annonce’).10763 Accordingly, Mr Ngaïssona’s actions in relation to the DDR\nprogramme have not been taken into consideration for the purpose of the present assessment.\nSimilarly, the Chamber does not consider that the fact of Mr Ngaïssona overseeing an\ninitiative to identify Anti-Balaka elements and provide them with badges constitutes a\ngenuine peace effort.10764 In this regard, it recalls its finding that the badges had a two-fold,\ninter-connected, purpose: (i) to distinguish what were considered ‘real’ from ‘fake’ Anti-\nBalaka; and (ii) for an eventual DDR programme.10765 The Chamber also recalls the\ntestimony of Aurélien Llorca who explained Mr Ngaïssona’s personal political motivations\nfor issuing the badges, notably to ‘prove’ that people were under Mr Ngaïssona’s\norganisation, as well as at the coordination’s initiative with a view to improving the Anti-\nBalaka’s visibility in the field, both towards local inhabitants and international forces.10766\nThe Chamber also takes note of the Ngaïssona Defence’s submissions regarding\nMr Ngaïssona’s creation of the PCUD party in November 2014 and disbanding of the Anti-\nBalaka movement.10767 The Chamber is unconvinced by the Ngaïssona Defence’s argument\nthat the fact that the creation of the PCUD risked the division of the Anti-Balaka movement\nshows that the PCUD was not a means for Mr Ngaïssona to gain power.10768 Instead it\nconsiders that the creation of the PCUD was primarily driven by Mr Ngaïssona’s political\n10762 See e.g. paragraphs 1601-1603 above.\n10763 See paragraph 1869 above.

My country remains my country. Today I’m\nliving in a refugee camp, and I am suffering. My town is Bossangoa. I have my\nrelatives. I would like to return to Bossangoa, but peace has not been restored in\nBossangoa. If I go back there now, I do not have a home. I have no way to survive. So\nI prefer to stay in the refugee camp here. And when I shall have the resources to rebuild\na house in Bossangoa when security would have been restored in my country, it will\nbe with joy that I would return and resettle in my native town of Bossangoa.10909\nConsidering the above, the Chamber finds that the consequences and harm of the\ncommission of the crimes under Counts 37 and 38 were high, with the victims not only\ndeprived of their property, but also effectively uprooted from their homes and communities,\n10903 See paragraph 3029 above.\n10904 See paragraph 3019 above.\n10905 See paragraph 3027 above.\n10906 See paragraphs 3033-3035 above.\n10907 See paragraph 3034 above.

P-1577 testified\nthat people were allowed to leave the school but if, for example, they wanted to travel and\npick things up from their homes, they had to go with an armed guard and not travel too far\naway from the protection of the camp for fear of being attacked.10925\nSecond, the Chamber notes the cramped and dire living conditions under which victims\nremained at the École de la Liberté.10926 In this context, the Chamber refers to the testimony\nof witnesses – who described, inter alia, the overall crowdedness and lack of proper\naccommodation and sanitation, the difficulties in operating the clinic, and the lack of proper\nschooling –, and to photographs [REDACTED].10927 It highlights that the Muslim civilians\nat the school stayed in such conditions for months, from December 2013 to February or, for\nsome, April 2014.10928\nThe Chamber finds the testimonies of P-1577 and P-2453 particularly illustrative in that\nregard. P-1577 explained that the École de la Liberté was ‘very densely populated’, with no\nsignificant latrines or sanitation available, a typical scene of a displaced camp, that is, a very\nbusy place with people cooking outdoors, the smell of cooking, lots of crying, uncomfortable\npeople, and dirty children.10929 P-2453 stated that although the École de la Liberté was very\nbig, comprised of six buildings:\n[…] it was not enough to accommodate all of us, some had to stay in tents outside. I\nwas sleeping in a classroom with many other people, we put the women and children\non one side and the men were on another side. We were all sleeping on mats on the\nfloor, only a few people who had arrived in early September had a mattress.10930\nThird, in light of the prevailing conditions around and at the École de la Liberté, all Muslim\ncivilians confined thereat could not only not return to their homes, but were eventually forced\nto leave Bossangoa altogether for Chad.10931 For instance, P-2462 testified that they\neventually left to Chad ‘because of the crisis.

In this regard, the Chamber highlights that the Anti-Balaka targeted a\nsubstantial number of Muslim civilians on religious grounds,10938 and violated numerous\nfundamental rights, namely, the right to life, right to physical integrity,10939 right to property,\nright to liberty and security of person, right to liberty of movement, and right against arbitrary\n10932 P-2657: T-104, p. 37, lines 10-15.

Therefore, it\naffords this factor only limited weight in determining the appropriate joint sentence.\n11026 See paragraphs 4002, 4102, 4229, 4340 above.\n11027 Ngaïssona Defence Oral Sentencing Submissions: T-311, p. 75, line 15 – p. 77, line 22.\n11028 Ngaïssona Defence Sentencing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2748, para. 37; Ngaïssona Defence Oral Sentencing\nSubmissions: T-311, p. 80, line 1 – p. 81, line 9.\n11029 Ngaïssona Defence Sentencing Brief, ICC-01/14-01/18-2748, para. 38, referring, inter alia, to the Unsworn\nStatement of Mr Ngaïssona, T-305.
